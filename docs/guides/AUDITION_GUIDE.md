# Voice Audition System

## Overview

Test 2-3 voice variants for a character before committing to full synthesis. Prevents wasted time on poor voice choices.

## Why Audition?

**Without auditions:**
- Synthesize hundreds of lines with wrong voice
- Discover quality issues too late
- Waste hours regenerating everything

**With auditions:**
- Test 3 variants in 5 minutes
- Compare side-by-side with different emotions
- Make informed choice before bulk synthesis

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\tenod\source\repos\BG2 Voiceover"
python scripts/audition.py Minsc
```

This will:
1. Load Minsc's character profile
2. Generate 3 voice variants (suggested presets)
3. Test each with 3 emotional phrases
4. Open comparison report in browser

### Custom Phrases

```powershell
python scripts/audition.py Jaheira neutral angry commanding
```

Test with specific emotional contexts.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Character Analysis

Audition system reads `data/characters.csv` to understand:
- **Gender** (M/F) - filters preset options
- **Archetype** (Boisterous, Stern, etc.) - suggests matching presets
- **Energy** (VeryHigh, Medium, Low) - validates energy match
- **Timbre** (Boomy, Cool, Wise) - ensures voice quality fits

### Step 2: Variant Selection

**Automatically generates 3 variants:**

1. **Current Preset** (if character has one)
2. **Suggested Presets** (based on archetype)
3. **Multi-Reference** (if reference file exists)

**Example for Minsc:**
- Variant 1: `male_booming` (current preset)
- Variant 2: `male_strong` (alternative)
- Variant 3: `male_heroic` (alternative)

### Step 3: Test Phrase Generation

Each variant is tested with multiple emotional contexts:

**Default phrases:**
- **Neutral**: "I understand. We should proceed with caution."
- **Happy**: "Excellent! This is exactly what we needed to find."
- **Angry**: "That's the last time I'll tolerate such behavior!"

**Additional options:**
- **Sad**: "I... I'm not sure I can go on like this anymore."
- **Commanding**: "Everyone, listen carefully. Here's what we're going to do."

### Step 4: Comparison Report

HTML report generated in `auditions/` folder with:
- ‚úÖ Character profile summary
- ‚úÖ Side-by-side audio players
- ‚úÖ All emotional variants
- ‚úÖ Quick selection buttons

## Preset Suggestions by Archetype

The system automatically suggests appropriate presets:

### Female Characters

| Archetype | Suggested Presets |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Cheery | female_bright, female_light, female_uplift |
| Stern | female_mature, female_strong, female_flat |
| Sardonic | female_cool, female_mature, female_sardonic |
| Timid | female_gentle, female_light, female_soft |
| Idealist | female_uplift, female_bright, female_gentle |

### Male Characters

| Archetype | Suggested Presets |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Boisterous | male_booming, male_strong, male_heroic |
| Arrogant | male_sardonic, male_cool, male_smooth |
| Stoic | male_flat, male_deep, male_wise |
| Charming | male_smooth, male_theatrical, male_noble |
| Menacing | male_deep, male_menacing, male_dark |
| Righteous | male_noble, male_wise, male_heroic |

## Complete Workflow

### Phase 1: Setup

1. Ensure character is in `data/characters.csv`
2. Set status to `Pending`

```powershell
python scripts/character_lib.py update Minsc Pending
```

### Phase 2: Audition

3. Run audition for character

```powershell
python scripts/audition.py Minsc
```

4. Browser opens with comparison report
5. Listen to all variants
6. Note which variant sounds best

### Phase 3: Selection

7. Update `data/characters.csv` with chosen preset:

```csv
Minsc,...,male_booming,...,Auditioned
```

8. Update `data/voices.json`:

```json
{
  "Minsc": {
    "voice": "male_booming"
  }
}
```

9. Update status:

```powershell
python scripts/character_lib.py update Minsc Auditioned
```

### Phase 4: Test Synthesis

10. Test with real dialogue:

```csv
# Add to data/lines.csv
99999,Minsc,"Go for the eyes, Boo! GO FOR THE EYES!"
```

11. Synthesize:

```powershell
python scripts/synth.py
```

12. Listen to `build/OGG/99999.wav`

### Phase 5: Lock

13. If quality is good:

```powershell
python scripts/character_lib.py update Minsc Locked
```

## Advanced Usage

### Audition with Multi-Reference

If you've already created a multi-reference file:

1. Update `characters.csv`:
```csv
Minsc,...,male_booming,refs/minsc_ref_multi.wav,Pending
```

2. Run audition:
```powershell
python scripts/audition.py Minsc
```

Now includes 4th variant using your reference!

### Compare Preset + Reference

Test both approaches:

```csv
# Character with both preset and reference
Jaheira,...,female_mature,refs/jaheira_ref_multi.wav,Pending
```

Audition generates:
- Variant 1: `female_mature` preset only
- Variant 2: Other suggested preset
- Variant 3: Multi-reference clone

### Custom Emotional Mix

For specific character personalities:

```powershell
# Minsc (heroic, simple)
python scripts/audition.py Minsc neutral happy commanding

# Edwin (arrogant, scheming)
python scripts/audition.py Edwin neutral angry sad

# Aerie (timid, compassionate)
python scripts/audition.py Aerie neutral sad happy
```

## Output Files

### Audio Files

```
auditions/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Minsc_1_neutral.wav      # Variant 1, neutral phrase
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Minsc_1_happy.wav         # Variant 1, happy phrase
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Minsc_1_angry.wav         # Variant 1, angry phrase

  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Minsc_3_neutral.wav      # Variant 3, neutral phrase
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Report File

```
auditions/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Minsc_audition.html      # Comparison report
```

**Note**: `auditions/` folder is gitignored (temporary files)

## Troubleshooting

### "Character not found"

Check spelling in `data/characters.csv`:
```powershell
python scripts/character_lib.py status
```

### "Failed to generate audio"

Index-TTS may have model loading issues:
- Wait 2-3 minutes for models to load
- Check Index-TTS is properly installed
- Verify config.yaml paths are correct

### "No variants generated"

Character needs preset suggestions:
1. Check `characters.csv` has `Archetype` filled
2. Manually add `VoicePreset` field
3. Or create multi-reference first

### "Audio sounds wrong"

This is expected! That's why we audition:
- Try different preset combinations
- Adjust emotional phrase mix
- Consider creating custom multi-reference

## Best Practices

### DO:
‚úÖ Audition before bulk synthesis
‚úÖ Test multiple emotional contexts
‚úÖ Compare preset vs reference (if both available)
‚úÖ Get second opinion (play for someone else)
‚úÖ Update characters.csv immediately after choosing

### DON'T:
‚ùå Skip auditions for important characters
‚ùå Test with only one emotional phrase
‚ùå Rush the decision
‚ùå Forget to update voices.json
‚ùå Leave character in "Pending" after audition

## Example: Complete Audition Session

### Minsc (Boisterous Ranger)

**Command:**
```powershell
python scripts/audition.py Minsc neutral happy commanding
```

**Variants Generated:**
1. Current: `male_booming` ‚≠ê (Winner!)
2. Suggested: `male_strong` (too generic)
3. Suggested: `male_heroic` (too serious)

**Decision:** `male_booming` matches Minsc's personality perfectly

**Actions:**
```powershell
# Update status
python scripts/character_lib.py update Minsc Auditioned

# voices.json already correct, test synthesis
python scripts/synth.py

# Quality confirmed, lock it
python scripts/character_lib.py update Minsc Locked
```

### Jaheira (Stern Druid)

**Command:**
```powershell
python scripts/audition.py Jaheira neutral angry sad
```

**Variants Generated:**
1. Current: `female_mature` (too soft)
2. Suggested: `female_strong` (too aggressive)
3. Multi-ref: `refs/jaheira_ref_multi.wav` ‚≠ê (Winner!)

**Decision:** Multi-reference captures her authoritative-but-caring tone

**Actions:**
```csv
# Update characters.csv
Jaheira,...,female_mature,refs/jaheira_ref_multi.wav,Auditioned
```

```json
// Update voices.json
{
  "Jaheira": {
    "voice": "female_mature",
    "ref": "refs/jaheira_ref_multi.wav",
    "emo_alpha": 0.9
  }
}
```

```powershell
python scripts/character_lib.py update Jaheira Locked
```

## Integration with Workflow

### Position in Pipeline

```
1. Character defined (Draft)
2. Status ‚Üí Pending
3. üé§ AUDITION ‚Üê You are here
4. Update voices.json
5. Status ‚Üí Auditioned
6. Test synthesis
7. Status ‚Üí Locked
8. Bulk synthesis
```

### Time Investment

- **Audition**: 5-10 minutes per character
- **Bulk synthesis without audition**: 1-2 hours (wasted if wrong voice)
- **ROI**: 10 minutes saves hours of rework
