# Character Profile Tool

Automatically generates character profiles including dialogue samples, voice characteristics, and audio availability.

## Usage

```powershell
python scripts/utils/character_profile.py <CharacterName>
```

## Examples

```powershell
# Get profile for Ilyich
python scripts/utils/character_profile.py Ilyich

# Get profile for any character
python scripts/utils/character_profile.py Yoshimo
python scripts/utils/character_profile.py Jaheira
python scripts/utils/character_profile.py Valygar
```

## What It Shows

### üìä Line Counts
- Chapter 1 lines (for current chapter work)
- Total game lines (full scope)

### üí¨ Sample Dialogue
- First 5-10 dialogue lines
- Helps understand character personality and speech patterns

### üé§ Voice Characteristics
**Automatically detected:**
- **Accent indicators**: Scottish, Theatrical, Upper-class, Archaic/Formal
  - Detected from dialect patterns: "laddie", "ye", "'tis", "indeed", etc.
  
- **Tone indicators**: Aggressive/Energetic, Inquisitive, Hesitant/Thoughtful
  - Based on punctuation and sentence structure
  
- **Speech patterns**: Military/commanding, Self-focused
  - Based on word choices and phrasing

### üéµ Audio Availability
- Searches for BG2 audio files matching the character
- If found: Shows count and confirms reference can be built
- If not found: Recommends similar companion voice

## Voice Recommendations

When no audio is available, the tool suggests companions with similar characteristics:

| Characteristic | Recommended Voice |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Scottish accent | Korgan (dwarven berserker) |
| Aggressive/Energetic | Minsc (ranger) |
| Theatrical | HaerDalis (tiefling bard) |
| Military/commanding | Keldorn (paladin) |
| Hesitant/Thoughtful | Cernd (druid) |

### Using Borrowed Voices

When using another companion's voice, configure with differentiation in `voices.json`:

```json
{
  "CharacterName": {
    "ref": "refs/borrowed_character_ref.wav",
    "preset": "appropriate_preset",
    "notes": "Description (borrowed from SourceCharacter)",
    "emotion": "borrowed_voice",
    "speed": 0.95,
    "pitch_shift": -2,
    "status": "Locked"
  }
}
```

- **emotion**: `"borrowed_voice"` marker tracks which characters use adapted companion voices
- **speed**: Slightly slower (0.95) or faster (1.05) to differentiate from original
- **pitch_shift**: Shift semitones up (+2) or down (-2) for vocal distinction

## Example Output

## Workflow Integration

### Before Creating Voice References

1. Run character profile to understand the character
2. Check if BG2 audio is available
3. If yes: Build custom reference from their audio
4. If no: Use recommended companion voice

### Example Workflow

```powershell
# Step 1: Get character info
python scripts/utils/character_profile.py Ilyich

# Step 2: Based on output, if audio available:
python scripts/utils/build_<character>_ref.py

# Step 3: If no audio, use recommended voice in voices.json
# Recommendation: "Korgan" ‚Üí Use Korgan's reference
```

## Adding to Future Chapters

When working on new chapters:

```powershell
# Quickly profile all speakers in a chapter
python -c "import csv; speakers = set(r['Speaker'] for r in csv.DictReader(open('data/chapter2_lines.csv', encoding='utf-8'))); [print(s) for s in sorted(speakers)]"

# Then profile each one
python scripts/utils/character_profile.py <SpeakerName>
```

## Technical Details

### Data Sources
- `data/lines.csv` - Full game dialogue
- `data/chapter1_lines.csv` - Chapter-specific lines
- `BG2 Files/` - Original audio files

### Accent Detection Patterns
- **Scottish**: laddie, 'is, givin', th', ye, 'em
- **Theatrical**: dost, thou, thee, forsooth, 'tis
- **Upper-class**: indeed, quite, rather, certainly
- **Archaic/Formal**: shall, thee, thy, doth

### Tone Detection
- **Aggressive**: Multiple exclamation marks
- **Inquisitive**: Multiple questions
- **Hesitant**: Ellipsis (...) usage

### Speech Patterns
- **Military**: Uses "lads", "boys", "men"
- **Self-focused**: Frequent "I", "my", "mine"
