2486,Minsc,"Boo points, I punch! Is very simple relationship, but it is effective."
2632,Minsc,We do good things here! All will remember the heroes that are Minsc and Boo and you!
2648,Minsc,"Nonsense! All enjoy the sight of heroes. We'll be the talk of the town for days! Wave to the nice people, Boo. Wave to the nice hamster, people. WAVE!"
2650,Minsc,"Yes! Lead evil by example, and one day we need no longer put the boots to those that stray off the path of goodness into the muck and bile of villainy and track great bloody footprints across our lily-white tiles! Boo will have clean wood shavings, you evil bastards!"
2651,Minsc,"Good has no need of low profiles! There is no shame in boasting if one follows through, and I am not about to keep my voice low! Perhaps Boo will, but not I!"
2669,Minsc,"We follow the path that surely leads to glory! Boo is proud to be here, I can tell."
2674,Minsc,"Then say it louder! We must inspire fear in evil! Quiet tales of hamsters are foolish, but a man and his hamster that tear evil limb from limb? That's scary!"
2676,Minsc,"Now you are speaking the language of Minsc! Next we must get you a hamster! Or perhaps an ice weasel, whatever your tastes."
2677,Minsc,It's good that I know you are kidding. I would hate to have to cleanse my own party of evil. Always strive to be on the safe end of the justice boot.
2678,Minsc,"I know I think clearly because Boo tells me so. That is enough for me, though it never seems to be enough for anyone else. Their loss, for I am content."
