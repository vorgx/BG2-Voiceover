5009,Dryad,Hold Undead
5041,Dryad,I did not so much get into adventuring as it was forced upon me.
18384,Ilyich,"Be alert, laddies! We've got company. Ho, prisoners! Ye've come to th' wrong place, I tell ye true! Ilyich and 'is boys'll stop you!"
18447,Ilyich,"Suffice to say, this place is your doom. By the time the master returns, you shall be dead and we shall be rewarded. At 'em, lads! No mercy!"
18449,Ilyich,I won't be givin' 'em to you. Come and get 'em... if you can!
18450,Ilyich,"At 'em, lads! No mercy!"
38537,Imoen,I can help you too. Should I not try? I hate to see you cooped up like that.
38539,Imoen,"Minsc, that is horrible! I am so sorry for you."
38543,Imoen,"Eww, I... really don't want to think about that too much."
38544,Imoen,I... I know this room. I've been in here... we both have. He... There are things in these tanks. They used to be people...
38559,Imoen,"What kind of monster is this guy? Captures us easy as pie, kills whoever he wants... that could have been us in those glass things."
38563,Imoen,"I don't know about that, Minsc, but he sure is a cute little fuzzy wuzzy. Aren't you, Boo?"
38584,Imoen,"We don't even know where we are, and my head is still doing funny things... He said something... something about potential."
38599,Imoen,"Are we? Horrible, horrible things surround us, and my head still hurts like crazy. I want to know what he did to me. I remember... something about potential."
38602,Imoen,He said it about you too: something about power that can be unleashed. I don't care; I just have to get out. Can we leave this room? It bothers me.
38603,Imoen,I want to know what he did to me too. My head still hurts really bad. He said... said something about potential... about you too.
38606,Imoen,"Wow, a golem. Powerful magic stuff. Odd that it's not hostile. I suppose its maker didn't expect us to escape, so it never got orders for restraining us."
38611,Imoen,"They only do exactly what they are directed to; they don't really think. If it hasn't been told to keep quiet, we might get some information out of it."
38612,Imoen,What...? What is this place? It'sâ€”it's beautiful! Oh... there is simply no way that this space belongs to the same person that owns those horrible glass containers.
38619,Imoen,"No, it can't be. Not the person I know. This... this bed, that table... I know of them. He would... he would speak of them while... while he..."
38620,Imoen,"It's for a lost love, kept in perfect condition. She... she despises him. This is his monument to her. He spoke of all of this, but... but his voice was cold..."
38621,Imoen,"No emotion at all, not even remembered. He spoke of these things even while he cut... he cut... and the spells that wove through my brain... cold, ugly things!"
38624,Imoen,"It still hurts... his sick fingers are still in my head, doing whatever it was he started. I see blood... and death... behind my eyes... Irenicus..."
38625,Imoen,"This room: If he could care for anything, he would care for this room. Above the lives of all of us. It makes me sick. I feel... I feel... so much hate."
38626,Imoen,"I would burn this place, but it is nothing. Even as it means so much, it is nothing. Let's do what we must and get out of this place; it is making me sick."
38627,Imoen,"We are nothing; that's why the golems don't care. Why bother worrying about gnats? Besides, he doesn't need to catch us. I can tell. I can feel it."
38628,Imoen,"Duergar, I think. Kind of evil, I guess, so I'm not surprised they would be working for our captor."
38631,Imoen,"For the knives, probably. The knives... he has a lot of them... I'm going to have a couple of scars from this... looks like you will too."
38632,Imoen,I doubt he cares for anything more than the quality of knives they make. He has a lot of them... I'm going to have scars from this... looks like you will too.
38633,Imoen,Jaheira... I wanna say how sorry I am about Khalid. I... I know this is hard...
38635,Imoen,"Stop calling me ""child."" I'm as old as you, and besides, I can tell you that Khalid did not suffer."
38637,Imoen,I'm not babbling! I saw him do this! Khalid was dead when our captor started... doing those things to him!
38639,Imoen,He... he showed me. He cut and... and showed me. He forced my eyes open and made me look as he...
38641,Imoen,"He said I should see, so I would understand, but I don't know what he wanted! He would cut and say ""Do you see?"" Cut and say ""Do you see?"""
38643,Imoen,"I am not a child! I'm as old as you, and I've... I've seen. I can see..."
38645,Imoen,"I see now... in my head... cut, ""yes, I see..."""
38647,Imoen,So beautiful! I used to dream of dryads and their beautiful trees.
38649,Imoen,"I used to dream... but he doesn't. Your charms don't work on him anymore, do they?"
38651,Imoen,Irenicus...
38653,Imoen,"No, death sounds different. He showed me... I spit on his name. I spit on this place."
38655,Imoen,"I have learned... something different. So beautiful you are. I almost can't see you. I just want to go home. Oh, when can we go home?"
38661,Imoen,I've gotta hand it to you... you sure have some kind of courage to sleep in this place. I would've run screaming a dozen times over if you weren't here.
38665,Imoen,"I guess I should be used to sleeping with both eyes open. I don't deal with this well. We're alike because of Gorion, but I prefer being in the background."
38671,Imoen,"He was a great mage, and supposedly a great adventurer. It's funny; we lived with him for years, and Jaheira seems to know more about him."
38672,Imoen,"I guess he was a big friend of the Harpers. Even got a visit from Khelben ""Blackstaff"" once. Real powerful mage. Talked to Gorion like an equal."
38674,Imoen,"I wish we could go back to those days, before all this fuss and bother. Before I learned... Well, we've seen so much. Candlekeep seems so small now."
38686,Imoen,"Seems like we're not important enough to worry about. I'm just not up to this like you. We're alike because of Gorion, but I prefer being in the background."
38690,Imoen,"Does it? Then I feel better. I figured I didn't deal with this as well as you. We're alike because of Gorion, but I prefer being in the background."
38697,Imoen,"Well, when people are in danger, sure. Winthrop taught me how to get out of trouble, but Gorion always said there are times when it's worth getting into it."
