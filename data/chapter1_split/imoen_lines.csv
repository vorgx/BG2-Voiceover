38537,I can help you too. Should I not try? I hate to see you cooped up like that.
38539,"Minsc, that is horrible! I am so sorry for you."
38543,"Eww, I... really don't want to think about that too much."
38544,I... I know this room. I've been in here... we both have. He... There are things in these tanks. They used to be people...
38559,"What kind of monster is this guy? Captures us easy as pie, kills whoever he wants... that could have been us in those glass things."
38563,"I don't know about that, Minsc, but he sure is a cute little fuzzy wuzzy. Aren't you, Boo?"
38584,"We don't even know where we are, and my head is still doing funny things... He said something... something about potential."
38599,"Are we? Horrible, horrible things surround us, and my head still hurts like crazy. I want to know what he did to me. I remember... something about potential."
38602,He said it about you too: something about power that can be unleashed. I don't care; I just have to get out. Can we leave this room? It bothers me.
38603,I want to know what he did to me too. My head still hurts really bad. He said... said something about potential... about you too.
38606,"Wow, a golem. Powerful magic stuff. Odd that it's not hostile. I suppose its maker didn't expect us to escape, so it never got orders for restraining us."
38611,"They only do exactly what they are directed to; they don't really think. If it hasn't been told to keep quiet, we might get some information out of it."
38612,What...? What is this place? It's—it's beautiful! Oh... there is simply no way that this space belongs to the same person that owns those horrible glass containers.
38619,"No, it can't be. Not the person I know. This... this bed, that table... I know of them. He would... he would speak of them while... while he..."
38620,"It's for a lost love, kept in perfect condition. She... she despises him. This is his monument to her. He spoke of all of this, but... but his voice was cold..."
38621,"No emotion at all, not even remembered. He spoke of these things even while he cut... he cut... and the spells that wove through my brain... cold, ugly things!"
38624,"It still hurts... his sick fingers are still in my head, doing whatever it was he started. I see blood... and death... behind my eyes... Irenicus..."
38625,"This room: If he could care for anything, he would care for this room. Above the lives of all of us. It makes me sick. I feel... I feel... so much hate."
38626,"I would burn this place, but it is nothing. Even as it means so much, it is nothing. Let's do what we must and get out of this place; it is making me sick."
38627,"We are nothing; that's why the golems don't care. Why bother worrying about gnats? Besides, he doesn't need to catch us. I can tell. I can feel it."
38628,"Duergar, I think. Kind of evil, I guess, so I'm not surprised they would be working for our captor."
38631,"For the knives, probably. The knives... he has a lot of them... I'm going to have a couple of scars from this... looks like you will too."
38632,I doubt he cares for anything more than the quality of knives they make. He has a lot of them... I'm going to have scars from this... looks like you will too.
38633,Jaheira... I wanna say how sorry I am about Khalid. I... I know this is hard...
38635,"Stop calling me ""child."" I'm as old as you, and besides, I can tell you that Khalid did not suffer."
38637,I'm not babbling! I saw him do this! Khalid was dead when our captor started... doing those things to him!
38639,He... he showed me. He cut and... and showed me. He forced my eyes open and made me look as he...
38641,"He said I should see, so I would understand, but I don't know what he wanted! He would cut and say ""Do you see?"" Cut and say ""Do you see?"""
38643,"I am not a child! I'm as old as you, and I've... I've seen. I can see..."
38645,"I see now... in my head... cut, ""yes, I see..."""
38647,So beautiful! I used to dream of dryads and their beautiful trees.
38649,"I used to dream... but he doesn't. Your charms don't work on him anymore, do they?"
38651,Irenicus...
38653,"No, death sounds different. He showed me... I spit on his name. I spit on this place."
38655,"I have learned... something different. So beautiful you are. I almost can't see you. I just want to go home. Oh, when can we go home?"
38661,I've gotta hand it to you... you sure have some kind of courage to sleep in this place. I would've run screaming a dozen times over if you weren't here.
38665,"I guess I should be used to sleeping with both eyes open. I don't deal with this well. We're alike because of Gorion, but I prefer being in the background."
38671,"He was a great mage, and supposedly a great adventurer. It's funny; we lived with him for years, and Jaheira seems to know more about him."
38672,"I guess he was a big friend of the Harpers. Even got a visit from Khelben ""Blackstaff"" once. Real powerful mage. Talked to Gorion like an equal."
38674,"I wish we could go back to those days, before all this fuss and bother. Before I learned... Well, we've seen so much. Candlekeep seems so small now."
38686,"Seems like we're not important enough to worry about. I'm just not up to this like you. We're alike because of Gorion, but I prefer being in the background."
38690,"Does it? Then I feel better. I figured I didn't deal with this as well as you. We're alike because of Gorion, but I prefer being in the background."
38697,"Well, when people are in danger, sure. Winthrop taught me how to get out of trouble, but Gorion always said there are times when it's worth getting into it."
38703,"Yeah, you're right. I don't want to spend a second more in this place than I have to. My head still hurts, and I keep seeing things in corners and such."
38704,"We won't be able to just walk away, you know. The guy that captured us... he knows about you. He said something about potential, something about great power."
38705,"Funny, that. I was sorry to go, but I couldn't let you wander off on your own, now could I? After Gorion d... died, you needed all the help you could get."
38706,"Not that I'm much help right now. My head still aches, and I keep seeing things. Too much death around here, everywhere. It's in everything, even me."
38707,"We still had friends there. They were proud, even if they didn't show it. Winthrop said so. He always thought Gorion was too stuffy. I don't know though."
38708,"Ooh, my head still hurts, and I keep thinking I see... things in the corners. Too much death here for my liking. It's in everything, even us."
38734,What a tortured creature that clone thing was. She was a copy? A copy of another person?
38735,I wonder why Irenicus made her? I doubt he took pleasure in her company; he's beyond that. He's fascinated with death. He showed me... over and over...
38787,"Oh... this reminds me so much of Candlekeep. Dusty old tomes all over, bookcases nearly spilling. It's... like we never left..."
38788,"But we did, didn't we? I just want to go home again. It doesn't matter where it is, just so long as I can call it home."
39761,Those dwarves that attacked us—I read about them when you were skipping out of lessons back in Candlekeep.
47215,"Something strange up here. Be careful, this place has all manner of dangerous devices in it. I don't know what they do, but I know we would be safer if we shut them off."
47220,"Do you smell that? Smells like lightning, but indoors? That can't be right. I think I remember. Look to the right... the machine making the storm..."
49035,Get out of my way! I don't want to fight any of you; I just want to leave!
56483,"Athkatla? That's... the City of Coin, right? A merchant city in Amn. We come from the Sword Coast, a ways to the north. Why do you think we're in Athkatla?"
58492,"Say we won't look back. I don't care if he can ""tap the power"" or access whatever avatar stuff. We've gotta get away from all this death."
58496,Means a lot to hear that. I can't stand all these shadows...
58497,"I appreciate that, but I doubt he meant you any good either. Didn't spare you the knives any more than me. Come on, I gotta get away from all these shadows."
58498,"Let it go, please? Whoever he is and whatever he can do, above it all, he's a vile bastard that's hurt us both. Come on, I gotta get away from all this death."
58502,"He said something like ""releasing power within you so it could be used,"" but if it means taking part in horrible things... I don't like this place. Can we go?"
58503,"I don't care if he could make us three ogres strong, I have to get out of this place. It bothers me. Makes me think I see... things."
58504,"As if I need another reminder. I don't care what power this guy thinks he can tap in you, he's just sick to the core. We can't ever look back."
