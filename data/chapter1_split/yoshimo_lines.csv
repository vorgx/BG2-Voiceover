2716,"So, there is sanity in all this madness. If you are not in league with the evil that dwells in this unholy place, Yoshimo begs your assistance."
2722,"I share your sentiments. I have seen much here that has disturbed me. I myself am a warrior with no evil intentions. Please, I would welcome any assistance you might offer."
2730,"I am no fiend! I am Yoshimo! You know, Yoshimo?"
2734,I do not know how long I was there before awaking.
2738,I do not know a way to escape this place. Perhaps we could search for this exit together.
2741,Perhaps then Yoshimo's predicament won't seem so funny!
2747,"At last, an admirer! I do not know a way to escape this place. Perhaps we could search for this exit together."
2755,What do you need to know?
2759,"If you are ever in Athkatla and need some assistance, I reside at the Copper Coronet, an inn of some renown. First, however, a warning..."
2763,You have changed your mind? Shall we draw our blades with a common purpose?
2770,"I agree. Welcome to the Copper Coronet, my home here in Athkatla. What can Yoshimo offer you? Information? Contacts? Equipment? Perhaps you would like me to join you?"
2783,"The barkeep's name is Bernard. He will sell you high-quality equipment at a reasonable price. If you have the time, though, I would suggest the Adventure Mart in the promenade."
2788,I would be honored to wield my sword for you.
2789,"Oh, taker of my honor, do not return to torment me further. Unless you have come to take back your cruel words, I ask you to leave now."
2792,"Welcome to the Copper Coronet, my home here in Athkatla. What can Yoshimo offer you? Information? Contacts? Equipment? Perhaps you would like me to join you?"
4292,"<CHARNAME>, it is good to see you again."
4349,I did not hurt the nymph! She released me from the fairy circle. I am a free man again and ready to join your party.
4358,"After the nymph released me, I ran to catch up with you and had a little run-in with a worg. The worg wounded me."
4362,It is the truth! I would not harm that innocent nymph! She released me from the fairy circle so that I could rejoin my companions. You must believe me!
4366,I am pleased to travel with you again.
4367,"I am very sorry to hear that. You shall find me in Athkatla should you need me. I will be staying at the Copper Coronet. Travel safely, <CHARNAME>."
4368,"When you have thought about this and realized your error, you will find me at the Copper Coronet in Athkatla. I will now take my leave of you."
18900,"These little beasties keep coming in through the portals. Perhaps if the portals are destroyed, one could defeat the beasts that have already come through."
18902,I have noticed that each wand is locked into the pedestal and could be removed if one had the proper key. I know not where these keys are. Let us begin!
20021,"Shortly beyond that chamber, there is a hallway that contains several wands mounted in pedestals. They blast all that walk before them."
20022,"It is actually quite uh... embarrassing. My profession does not leave itself open to those who are not wary, yet somehow I was caught unaware."
20023,"I came to Athkatla years ago from Kara-Tur to seek my fortune. At some point, I went to bed in my room at the Copper Coronet, and I awoke in a strange room with a very sore head."
20024,Maybe you should try to face the perils of this place alone!
20025,"I am unsure. I may have been drugged when I was brought here. I may have been unconscious... either way, I do not know how long."
20030,"If that is how you wish it to be, then go ahead and forge the trail. I will follow your path once I have rested a bit."
20058,You do not know what happened! I must leave now before my anger rises any more.
20067,"One more thing... you will find a wide hall before too long that contains several wands mounted on pedestals. If you walk before these wands, you may be killed."
20072,"I am not sure how I came to be here... like you, I suspect. I have been trying to find my way out, but I was wounded in my attempt to do so."
20074,"In the next chamber beyond the one in which we stand, four portals lie. Each of these portals releases a little cackling fiend which tries to kill me."
20082,"In the next chamber beyond the one in which we stand, four portals lie. Each of these portals releases a little cackling fiend which tries to kill me."
20090,"Shortly beyond that chamber, there is a hallway that contains several wands mounted in pedestals. They blast all that walk before them."
20103,"In the next chamber, there are four portals. Each of these portals releases little cackling fiends which try to kill me."
