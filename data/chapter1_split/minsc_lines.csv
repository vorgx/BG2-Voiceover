2486,"Boo points, I punch! Is very simple relationship, but it is effective."
2632,We do good things here! All will remember the heroes that are Minsc and Boo and you!
2648,"Nonsense! All enjoy the sight of heroes. We'll be the talk of the town for days! Wave to the nice people, Boo. Wave to the nice hamster, people. WAVE!"
2650,"Yes! Lead evil by example, and one day we need no longer put the boots to those that stray off the path of goodness into the muck and bile of villainy and track great bloody footprints across our lily-white tiles! Boo will have clean wood shavings, you evil bastards!"
2651,"Good has no need of low profiles! There is no shame in boasting if one follows through, and I am not about to keep my voice low! Perhaps Boo will, but not I!"
2669,"We follow the path that surely leads to glory! Boo is proud to be here, I can tell."
2674,"Then say it louder! We must inspire fear in evil! Quiet tales of hamsters are foolish, but a man and his hamster that tear evil limb from limb? That's scary!"
2676,"Now you are speaking the language of Minsc! Next we must get you a hamster! Or perhaps an ice weasel, whatever your tastes."
2677,It's good that I know you are kidding. I would hate to have to cleanse my own party of evil. Always strive to be on the safe end of the justice boot.
2678,"I know I think clearly because Boo tells me so. That is enough for me, though it never seems to be enough for anyone else. Their loss, for I am content."
2682,"As long as some are scared and tell the rest, that is all that matters. Come, we must press on against the tide of naughtiness. Mind your step."
2683,"I don't understand the reference, but Boo enjoyed it. An omen of good things... or of horrible and humorous death, I am not sure which."
2684,These acts will place our names in the songs of skalds and bards from here to my home! There can be no doubt.
2685,I will not tolerate actions such as this! We should strive to be just and fair.
2689,"When making a glorious egg dish of goodness, I understand some eggs must be broken. But actions such as this are... simply deplorable!"
2693,"Words are just loud air. Actions must take priority in my mind. A phrase might cause some discomfort, but it is good deeds that cause evil the most pain."
2694,"That is all that can be asked. A crusade might be better, but few have the focus required. I will be the example if anyone wishes to follow in my wake."
2695,"A hero needs no profit. A sword is just a few coins; armor is only a few more. No, it is evil that needs gold to fund their machinations, not heroes."
2696,"I, uh... I could use a bit of a lie-down... lest I drop Boo on the battlefield. Have we a healer near?"
2700,"Yes, that would be best. I should not like evil to get the jump on a weakened Minsc. We must be at our best for the fight to come."
2701,Minsc is no weakling! I have survived more than you could bear! It is just unwise to let wounds go untreated! Enemies will find their work half done already!
2702,"I know this, but Boo worries."
2703,Ugh! We must rest and get healthy. It would not do for us to be caught unsuspecting with Minsc in this kind of shape.
2704,I do not get through many battles without injury. Why is Minsc always on the front line taking damage?
2713,"Perhaps I am a touch quick to combat, but I temper my temper with common sense about who I should attack. What? I do too! Why does Boo snicker?"
2717,"If I protect more people by being at the forefront, then so be it! I shall charge in an instant and make my enemies sorry they were born as bad as they are!"
2735,"If that is what you think, then you do not know Minsc. I never cower! Boo does, but he fears being underfoot. I do not! I am the over-foot placing evil at end-of-boot!"
2774,"If you don't care about your party, then it will be you that is left on the battlefield eventually! I can only fight as long as I have my health..."
3022,"Boo is a fine friend, and powerful in ways you don't let yourself see! To insult Boo is to insult all things small that try hard. Oh, and Minsc as well."
14216,"Boo is no rat, tiny one. He is a space hamster, and he will go for the eyeballs of children who call him rat."
14247,No. I have had enough of tiny people trying to steal Boo. Away!
14311,"Stupid is as stupid does, young one. So says Boo."
14496,"No! Boo is NOT for eating! Boo is mighty and wise and probably quite stringy. Er, and he is my companion!"
14533,I am sorry. I am only for Boo and my witch.
15461,I am not impressed by fighting slaves. But I would CRUSH any true opponent who dared to face me!
15959,You are coming from Rashemen? I remember it fondly and hope to take Boo to see it once I have completed my dajemma.
15960,No. Boo is my hamster. And Boo is my friend.
24851,Yes? You talking to Minsc?
24855,"Boo says such a sphere will not fit into my pocket. If I can't carry it with me, it's just not a good buy."
24858,Yes indeed. Boo is exceptionally smart for a hamster. Smarter than all the hucksters in Calimshan.
24861,"He mutters occasionally about fellow hamsters that will kill you all, but he is just moody, so don't worry. See how he glares? Shhh, we should leave him be."
25009,"Nobody cheats Minsc! If somebody dares to cheat me, they are in for a boot-stomping adjustment to their moral value systems!"
25370,I am always willing to help those in need! I will give your troubles the one-two boot-stomp of goodness!
25375,"I sometimes feel lost, but Boo tells me where to go. Boo points, I punch! Well, Boo actually just kind of runs, but I still punch! Yes, sir!"
25378,"Boo knows everything and is ever so willing to help others. You... you are kind to animals, aren't you? Rodents in particular?"
25380,"Boo doesn't like rats either. Something about their tails makes him... edgy, and you don't know creepy until you've seen an edgy hamster!"
25385,"Yes, Boo is friend to all. Such greatness, packed into a small, furry bundle of goodness."
25452,Eh? You are speaking of me? How do you know this?
25589,"No. I do not act. I fight, and fight for real."
25649,"I am sorry, little halfling."
25686,Why does this impish halfling jump around me like that? Is he dancing? Boo likes it when halflings dance around!
25807,I think this is good for you. Boo also is sending his congratulations.
26277,"I might join your hunt another time, but seabirds make Boo uncomfortable. It is best I spare them his wrath. Yes, best for all! But I must go now, little one."
27689,Boo is no pet... he is a fine companion for Minsc. But he seems to like you anyway.
29580,Perhaps people just need a swift kick in the punctuals!
29582,"No, I seldom have time for reading. Too much work to be done!"
29662,"Why? In beloved Rashemen, if things don't work, we encourage them with a loving backhand of productivity!"
29838,"A thinking game! Minsc knows the answer then! Evil ends in death, because I put my foot in its backside!"
29839,Oops. I apologize.
29854,This is a foolish question! Who travels with you? Minsc does! What else matters?
29857,"Oops. I apologize. Next time, I let Boo answer."
30107,"You cannot have Boo, little girl! But you may pet him and make pretty cooing noises if you wishes."
33134,Boo is not food. Maybe I should throw you to the cute little meat-eaters and see how you like it?
38668,This is silly! Buttons are not how one escapes dungeons! I would smash the button and rain beatings liberally down on the wizard for playing such a trick!
38696,"Irenicus? There is a special place in my bootprint for him, and I shall fill it in the name of Dynaheir! Such evil to keep forest spirits locked away!"
38723,"I would hate being forgotten in a bottle. It might depend somewhat on the type of bottle, but overall I expect the effect would be similar. It is not right."
38764,"We must help this child! I will find who took his mother and teach them a thing or three about decency, respect, and keeping their hands off of people's parents!"
38774,Owl wizards?
38779,"It is no risk! Not so long as we have swords and braveness to the brim of the tall glass of goodness! Right, Boo?"
38911,I will protect my witch! EVIL SHALL SUFFER AT THE HANDS OF MINSC AND HIS WITCH! WOE TO THOSE WHO WOULD BRING DANGER TO AERIE!
38936,We must aid him! Evil stands before me and demands a quick kick in the posterior!
38943,"I will not stand and watch men carting slaves! THEY SHALL FEEL MY BLADE AND BOOT AND BACKHAND AS WELL! GO FOR THE EYES, BOO, GO FOR THE EYES!"
38960,"Hmmm... the sphere is awfully big for only 500 gold pieces. It might be a good bargain. What say you, Boo?"
39182,"We shall go and save the village for the boy! I will crush the evil! All of the evil! Even the small, rodent-sized evil... although that is more Boo's job."
39270,They throw this man into a pit with a wild beast? This is a crime against man AND nature! They will surely feel my wrath for this travesty!
39288,"We are going to free this warrior and his people? This is a task of great honor! We shall be great heroes for this, heroes doing heroic things for all to see!"
39353,"This man is a great evil if he does such things! The shining blades of goodness must be raised against him! Justice demands a painful, pointy thrashing!"
39365,"More children kept as slaves! Boo is outraged by the evil that leaps about this city like a hot-footed weasel! We must save the children, we must!"
39403,"It cannot be! I would sooner tear out my eyes than strike down innocent animals! Well, perhaps only one eye... but do not think me any less incensed!"
39410,"You will not! I will fight to save each and every creature, dwarf! The forest feeds and nurtures, and I will not hesitate to put a birch up your backside!"
39411,"Why? I have never heard such head-biting villainy, except perhaps in the larger cities, but what passes for entertainment these days is not for me to decide."
39412,"Your strange jest is wearing thin, dwarf. I suggest you sate yourself with chicken in the proper place and time, and leave the woodland creatures as they were."
39419,"You insult you, and you insult Minsc! There will be liberal butt-kicking now!"
39425,You pay for dogs to fight in this filthy place? You cannot imagine my anger! I shall find properly heroic companions elsewhere if you continue such outrages!
39591,"Irenicus? There is a special place in my bootprint for him, and I shall fill it in the name of Dynaheir! Such evil to keep forest spirits locked away here!"
40230,"What? No, Boo is no glove! Boo is a hamster, and far more than a handful if he wishes, tiny woman!"
42222,"A brave man has fallen here, but that is no cause to hurl insults at the living. Here, Boo shall comfort you."
44075,Pirate Lord? Such a name does not conjure images of righteous behavior. Stand still a moment and let Boo have a look at you.
44077,Boo will soon have you figured out. You certainly seem friendlier than I would think a Pirate Lord would be. And where is your peg?
44079,"Your peg. A proper pirate has a peg, whether a leg, arm or... uh... some other expendable extremity. And a parrot."
44081,"Certainly! As I have my Boo, so too must you have your parrot. Boo likes parrots. They could wrassel."
44176,"Little Imoen, it is Minsc. See, here's Boo... Boo, stop that. It's Imoen. Sure she looks a bit... stressed, but it's still her."
44177,I don't know what's wrong. Boo is all jittery. Something is different about Imoen.
47088,"Oooh! This is most goodness of news, is it not, Boo?"
48504,"What? They have no shame in trading lives of others? Evil, meet my trusty sword! Sword: MEET EVIL!"
48525,Ooh! To take swords against monsters of great evil! Already I feel Boo wriggling in excited anticipation!
48526,"Of course it is Boo. Boo is always happy when opportunities for heroism come! We shall crush these ogres, and rangers and hamsters everywhere shall rejoice!"
48559,I... would strike for goodness... but this dragon is so... so... It would not be cowardice to come back another day with bigger swords!
48585,We must find this fiend who steals children and disguises knights as monsters and apply a butt-kicking for goodness! All must be avenged!
48615,This changes everything! A fellow ranger plunged into peril by evil wizards! Even Boo cringes at what we have been sent to do! this cannot be!
48618,A fellow brother of the woods! Is this the man the wizards have sent us to kill? tell me it is not so!
48623,"You... you would not lead Boo and me astray! We do good things; we are heroes! This man lies, I say, and I shall fight with you!"
48624,"No! I will not allow you to kill a fellow brother of the woods! You have become evil, and I have allowed it to happen! No longer will I stand by!"
48631,"Be welcome, brother of the woods! Together, you and Boo and I shall stride forward to crush all evil in our wake! Woe betide evil!"
48713,"Me? No, Boo would never allow such a thing! My sword is meant only for being firmly planted in the heart of evil!"
48783,"WHERE? Where is there a rat? Oh, you have frightened Boo with your screeching. Calm yourself, Boo. See? We are leaving the loud woman."
48852,"*sniff* Ahh, even Boo cringes from such a foul odor. Surely this instrument will never make beautiful music again."
48902,"They... they attack this funny man? Why? This evil must be stopped with generous doses of sword-swinging! Come, Boo, we go for the eyes!"
48946,"Heroes of goodness need no warning! Where we tread, evil trembles in our wake!"
48959,"I would rather have given a sword. Give a man a fish and he eats for a day, but teach a man to fight and he can chow down on the meaty marrow of evil!"
48968,"Wha-aat? This is the evil man who steals skins? He must be stopped! He must be stopped, or all who have skins will sleep in fear!"
48969,"We shall answer your attack, though even Boo sees no sense in it!"
49023,"I understand none of this, but if the one who killed Dynaheir is beyond, Boo and Minsc will make short work of you!"
49269,"We don't need money to find Imoen! We are heroes! We will crush wizard after wizard to find her! Hmm, we should start soon if we hope to be done by dinner..."
49320,I remember you! And so does Boo! A craven wizard who travels with his untrustworthy halfling!
49415,"Oh, I never step on toes... except by accident, maybe. If Boo had me step on toes for real, toes would gloriously be flying everywhere in the wake of my sword!"
49474,"You shall be called what you are! You are an enemy of fair, departed Dynaheir and therefore an enemy of mine! You shall be destroyed for the good of all!"
49479,"You will not speak of sweet Dynaheir in this fashion! Terrible hamster justice will be wreaked upon you! GO FOR THE EYES, BOO, GO—"
49481,"I... no. No, our cause must not be disrupted. Righteous fury will wait for now, but one day the wizard shall pay for his words with blood! So swears Minsc!"
49506,"My anger can only barely be contained! Speak to us as if we are anything but heroes, wizard, and you shall be receiving the rented-mule beating you deserve!"
49510,"Dynaheir's enemy comes with us? Please, say it will not be so! And if it is so, let it be brief! Boo shakes with such anger I cannot blame him!"
49554,We do the bidding of thieves now? Ehhh... this churns my belly like a hamster running endlessly within a wheel. This can't be a good sign.
49556,"Rashemen is my home, but I haven't seen it for many moons. I am on my dajemma. I... failed my last witch... but nothing will happen to Aerie! Nothing!"
49557,"No, it will not be! let Minsc and Boo take their chances here. Do not abandon Imoen to this place."
49579,Poisoned and dying! The tragedy of it sings in my skull! We must hurry and deliver this man to safe harbor!
49784,Such an offer from this woman sends chills up and down my spine like angry weasels... but you will know what to do. Even Boo is confident of this.
49821,"It is an option that bears no questioning! you are a champion of good, just as we all are! Always must we take the choice of righteousness!"
49833,No! Tell me this is not so! No heroes would commit such an act! I could never look Boo in the eyes again if I took part in such a thing!
49840,"My hamster's heart is crushed that you have fallen so far! How could this be? It is my fault, all mine, for letting it happen!"
49843,"I... I must leave to drown in my sorrows. If you pick yourself up, I shall be in that Copper Coronet. It seemed like a grand place for adventure, oh yes!"
49847,"This is more like it! A rescue from the hostage-takers! All shall quiver in the wake of our righteous fury! Yes, Boo, show them how they will quiver!"
49856,We will charge into the midst of the den of thieves and fling them about like pancakes! All that is glory shall be ours! And then breakfast.
49871,"Those who bury the living must be buried by our righteous fury! Woe betide those who would flout justice! So says Minsc, though ""betide"" was Boo's word."
49909,You would keep this woman a prisoner? Boo is not convinced that this is right. I agree that it smells of evil. Bad you! Bad!
49911,"So the woman is freed? What need is there to collect a reward from the man? Are we not heroes, you and Boo and I? This is most confusing."
49968,"It is more dangerous to call Boo a vermin, as he may leap upon you and show you his true warrior spirit. Nothing can contend with the might of an angry hamster!"
50041,"An assault on the most foul and evil of creatures! Such a victory shall make us heroes to be sung of throughout the land! Glory will be ours, oh yes!"
50093,The priest turns on us! For shame! Boo will gnaw on his eye sockets for this travesty!
50106,"We are stopping now? Why are we stopping? We are heroes, and heroes must face the final enemy and win over all!"
50122,"Boo remembers! Baldur's Gate! Neb the child murderer! You die, gnome, you die! RAAAAAGGGGGHHHH!"
50130,Tiny has met a god before this?
50301,"Boo is my stalwart companion, and he says that if you must wear the skins of a dead animal around your neck, the evil sharp-toothed weasel is a good choice."
50343,"Minsc and Boo fight with swords and teeth for goodness, not for countries. We are heroes, not soldiers, funny man."
50416,"He attacks? Such a display of wrongness fills even Boo with disgust! For my hamster, I must land a blow for goodness!"
50537,They... they will not burn the pretty elf? There must be no burning if she has committed no crime! This is not justice! we stop this travesty!
50557,"We do not rescue her? What was her crime? Maybe darker elves are not all good, but surely not all are totally evil? I am... confused. What does Boo think?"
50578,"We have saved her, and she is our responsibility. What if she was captured again? Neither Boo nor I could live with ourselves. No, she must come."
50670,Boo is worried that these inmates will harm themselves. We should see that they are safe and make sure they each have a hamster of their own.
50671,That last part was my idea.
52288,"True heroes demand no reward, and Boo knows you to be a true hero! We need only know what foes we are to face before the boot-stomping can begin!"
52295,No! Say it cannot be so! we must rescue the nice man's child and be off! Unless... unless you have some plan? Minsc is confused.
52306,No! Has you truly fallen so far? A glorious rescue has turned into a nightmare of epic proportion! Minsc and Boo will stop you!
52607,Boo knows! Do not stow thrones in grass houses!
55186,"The evil wizard is dead! Once again, Boo and Minsc and you emerge as victorious heroes! Much rejoicing and celebrating must be commencing soon!"
55208,"Oh, such a glorious death in battle for Minsc and Boo! We were well on our way to the great fields and halls of Rashemen, but we felt you needing us, so we came!"
55668,"This young minstrel has lost his wits and his songs? Minds are common enough, but tunes of merit are few and far between."
55680,"Yes! Such fire and conviction! A pity there are no actual enemies to warrant the screaming, but good show anyway. Boo applauds!"
55684,"It is okay to come out now, Boo. The pale woman is gone. You can stop shivering too. You are a warrior hamster, so be brave! Brave!"
55689,All good peoples hang their head in shame! We are betrayed! The sailor man brings the vampires back amongst us... there shall be a mighty reckoning for this!
55694,"I do not think Boo is too thrilled about you borrowing his face. He only has the one. You don't hurt those you mirror, do you?"
55763,"Ughh, my head spins. So many quick words from so many small sources. Countersong, Boo. Relax my frazzled nerves."
55767,What does everyone stare at? Boo's churring calms me down. See?
55776,"Yes! Revenge! Revenge for precious Dynaheir! Tremble, wizard, for the mighty Boo will have your eyes! RAAAARRRRGHH!"
55784,"That's a much shorter interjection than Boo has become used to, Jan. Are you ill?"
55819,No! No collar! I will not be collared by the smelly fishmen! My warrior spirit will not bear such a thing!
55825,"Boo too has small teeth compared to fish-men. But they hurt just the same when they latch onto the eyes, yes sir!"
55861,"My skin may not have scales, but it has seen many suns come and go. Boo thinks you could use some sun too. Then you might not smell so much like wet laundry."
55882,"Don't worry, Aerie. I'm here to protect my witch. Boo too, though I think he would leap to protect anyone in distress. It's his heroic nature, you know."
55892,"Boo bristles at his words. I don't know the language, but he is insulting us for certain!"
55915,I cannot believe my ears! You would stand against all that is good and right? You shall suffer a terrible vengeance for this!
55922,Yes! Hello! Minsc is a drow! And Boo is a shadow hamster!
55968,"Another drow who speaks strange words! Even Boo bristles at his obvious lies! If you fights, then so does Minsc! Prepare for liberal butt-kickings!"
56017,"Ooh, another drow! I begin to see them everywhere, ever since the Underdark! They are so vicious even Boo cowers. What will we do?"
56018,I do not cause trouble! I merely seek it out and put the bootheels of justice to it! Ask Boo!
56067,"Boo is impressed, Korgan. You remember well to act like drow."
56086,"For Dynaheir and all fallen comrades, for what is good and right, for all these things shall Minsc and Boo fall upon you today! And we shall taste victory, evil man!"
56092,"Neither do we, right, Boo?"
56093,What's so funny?
56112,"I grow tired of shouting battle cries when fighting this mage. Boo will finish his eyeballs once and for all so he does not rise again! Evil, meet my sword! SWORD, MEET EVIL!"
56124,"Worry not, Viconia! Minsc and Boo stand at the ready to protect! Right, Boo?"
56127,No! You will not attack the small dark ones! Minsc and Boo will not allow it! And I hope no other will either!
56152,"And then Minsc will disrupt them with his bootheel! Yes, speak more of this evil-smashing partnership!"
56170,Boo shakes with disbelief! Such a crime will not go unanswered!
56198,Boo would have found her wherever she tried to put her evil foot! That's what we do!
56409,"Irenicus is the most vile of villains if he dared destroy a whole city! I can't believe that, and I have believed some amazing things, let me tell you!"
56420,"Groves are wonderful... you wouldn't really poison one, would you? Boo suggests that perhaps you are tricking this evil little man. Smart thinking, I agree."
56429,This is the evil killer who takes skins that do not belong to him! We have discovered him! We must take the bootheel to his ways!
56458,"To decide between justice and honor! Oh, it is a conundrum that would tie even Boo up in knots. I do not envy you. My decisions are usually easier than this."
56471,No! Minsc did not come here to kill young girls! You cannot tell us that the young girl was anything but innocent! This is not right!
56482,"We serve no evil mages, no sir! But Boo looks upon you with suspicion, little man. How is it you come to be here? Never have I seen Boo's whiskers quiver so!"
56484,"Then you too know the hardship of being set into a maze like a helpless hamster! We are comrades in peril! Boo asks what you propose we do next, little man."
56492,"What is this? Minsc and Boo were just getting into this wonderful story when it was sadly interrupted. A work of mastery, this is!"
56499,"Someone has rattled the little one's brains? Hmm, I know how she feels. If this was done on purpose, he deserves a mighty kick in his posterior at the least!"
56514,Helping others is good! What a nice little girl you are. Would you like to see my Boo? I think he approves of you too.
56515,Helping others is good! What a nice little girl you are. Would you like to see my Boo? I think he approves of you too.
56675,"I don't wish to alarm you, but Boo is absolutely fretting about your condition. Are you well? Fear in Boo is uncommon, and usually weasel-caused."
56679,"We can rest if you wish. I do not understand what Irenicus did, but Boo has said that it was traumatic, and I will guard if we must stay here a while."
56680,"That is good. I will guard if you need to rest. It is the least I can do, since I could not stop Irenicus."
56682,"Then Minsc and Boo will turn their attentions to more important things, like staying alive. We should get moving if you are through with your headache."
56881,"Boo does not think so, despite your kind words. You smell of treachery. Prove me wrong or face the boot!"
56886,You'd have bought a trip to the graveyard if you had spent the money we needed to rescue Imoen! Minsc and Boo would see to that!
57740,"When all others stand numb, it falls to Minsc and Boo to make comment. you..."
57741,Boo just soiled my backpack.
57901,"Boo does not favor the odds, but I have no doubt we will succeed!"
57905,Boo would have sensed any treachery long ago! She fights well with us!
58137,Boo concurs! We must hurry and dispense with this errandry so we can get to the fighting of greater evils more worthy of my bootprint!
58138,"Minsc and Boo will protect your street, Aerie! You will cross it for your pleasure, not for fear of it!"
58179,Then let us get going! Boo and I have several talents we will unleash upon it!
58199,Minsc owes much to the killer of Dynaheir! I stand with you! Nowhere shall I go until the heel of justice has been firmly imprinted once and for all into the wizard's evil backside! Nowhere!
58519,No! We do not abandon comrades! Never could I look Boo in the face again after such a thing! We shall give the evil wizard a certain boot-kicking instead!
58756,"A slap in the face of our trust! A sword to the heart of our confidence! A boot to the prunes of our friendship! Perhaps I go too far, but Boo is absolutely incensed!"
59069,"Minsc and Boo are the greatest of warriors, small one! I will crush your foes into little foe-shaped chunky bits! Who dares pick on you? Just point the way!"
59071,"No foes? I am relieved. I trust those who prey on children no farther than they can be thrown, even if I manage to throw them pretty far, and throw them I shall!"
59072,"What? Boo is outraged! See his fury! It's small, so look close. Trust me, it's there. What is wrong with your village, small one? How can we heroes help?"
59073,"Minsc has been inside out and angry before, and it is never a good thing. Sometimes it frightens even Boo."
59075,"Oh! Minsc has never been crazy, no sir. Being inside out was bad enough! Is there more, little boy?"
59076,"Then heroes are certainly needed! Heroes like Minsc and Boo and you! Where is your village, small one? Together we will save the day!"
59078,"Nothing removes fear better than a good sword and a swift kick in the evil! We shall go to your village and do what heroes do, right?"
59088,"There is always time to save the day! Don't worry, small one, we will go to your village as soon as I restore you to their senses. That is my job."
59089,Kicking the posterior of evil is never a fool's errand! Hmm is not their usual heroic self today. An evil influence? Or have their thoughts wandered elsewhere?
59090,"Since you are out of their mind, I must step up as a hero should. We go to your village as soon as you are better. So swear Minsc and Boo."
59091,Er... Boo wonders what you need a warrior for when you have no foes?
59093,"Boo is curious and keeps bringing up the question of when we will travel to the Imnesvale village, and I heartily agree! We are heroes, and they are in need of heroes—it is a match even Minsc can see!"
59094,"We must go where evil is in most need of a beating, so Minsc will leave that decision up to you. Still... we must not disappoint the little boy."
59095,"Did Minsc miss something? Did we already go and save the Imnesvale village? Boo demands that it is not so, but I cannot remember. Surely we would not shirk out heroic duty for so long! It cannot be!"
59421,"We come because the little boy, Delon, said that there was evil here in need of a butt-kicking! And good for us that we have our boots on, yes, sir!"
59423,"No, we can't leave this place without having destroyed all evil! Tell Boo this is not so! Do not destroy a young hamster's innocence!"
59424,Wolves? Ogres? Witches? Oh my! It is too much for Minsc's poor head to comprehend! Which of these are evil? The edge of my sword shall find the truth!
59425,"Oh, most glorious day! One step closer we come to being true heroes, yes indeedy! Even little Boo's fur stands on end from his anticipation!"
59542,Minsc agrees! It would be the essence of epic heroing! Dead dragons should litter our path wherever we go!
60851,"Bah, omens are for those that pay attention to their surroundings, not for such as we, right, Boo?"
60868,"Anyway, go out of city that way... Keep on the road, turn right at big church, and you will be out."
60876,"Boo says not to blame myself, but Boo is a hamster and not as concerned with honor."
60880,"Actually, this changes very little. Minsc is happy."
60881,And perhaps my Boo as well...
60882,And a good sword...
60883,"Ooh! And the occasional buffing, for the armor, you understand."
61013,"No, this cannot be! The murderer of Dynaheir flees from righteous butt-kicking vengeance! And he takes Imoen with him too!"
61014,"Something must be done! We must find this evil wizard! All that is goodness cries out for this! Even little Boo, although he cannot cry out quite so loudly."
61017,No! We must go quickly and save our friend Imoen! The wizard may be leering over her evilly even now!
74513,"He's not that ugly. Boo's seen much uglier half-orcs. Haven't you, Boo?"
74615,Are you calling Boo a fool?
74692,I'm with the hamster.
74818,Boo says it's rude to diminish a bride's radiance on her wedding day.
75728,"What do you think, Boo? Isn't this a nice tree?"
75729,Boo doesn't think this is a nice tree.
75730,I think Boo is right.
77677,Speak for yourself! Boo is the warm center of the universe that I orbit during my slumber each night!
78870,Trusts?
79469,"Boo dislikes this place. These people are trapped in a wheel that turns and turns, but never moves forward."
79523,"Boo dislikes this place. These people are trapped in a wheel that turns and turns, but never moves forward."
80995,"It's all right, Boo. They're dead, but I'm sure they're not bad—"
80996,"You were right, Boo. They weren't nice at all."
81824,Boo says smoking isn't healthy.
88082,"Minsc is torn! It seems only fair that you be able to walk with a small animal to advise them, too. But Minsc also fears for Boo... Dings might have a bad attitude toward hamsters."
90282,Boo says we should find the hairband! Boo believes the children are our future!
93536,"You will need an advisor, heir to the throne! It is Minsc's opinion that hamsters make the best advisors."
