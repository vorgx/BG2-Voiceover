5009,Dryad,Hold Undead
5041,Dryad,I did not so much get into adventuring as it was forced upon me.
18384,Ilyich,"Be alert, laddies! We've got company. Ho, prisoners! Ye've come to th' wrong place, I tell ye true! Ilyich and 'is boys'll stop you!"
18447,Ilyich,"Suffice to say, this place is your doom. By the time the master returns, you shall be dead and we shall be rewarded. At 'em, lads! No mercy!"
18449,Ilyich,I won't be givin' 'em to you. Come and get 'em... if you can!
18450,Ilyich,"At 'em, lads! No mercy!"
17945,Valygar,"I see. If you are loyal followers, then I have little choice but to fight. You shall not take me peaceably to my doom at the hands of my ancestor, of that I am certain."
17950,Valygar,"My proposal is that we return to the city and enter the sphere. That way, I will know if Lavok lives. If he does, we can exterminate his ghoulish existence once and for all."
17961,Valygar,I refuse. I prefer the goodwill of the Cowled Wizards and the reward for you.
17967,Valygar,The wizards have not been entirely truthful. How do you propose we solve this?
17972,Valygar,The wizards will not rest until they get inside the sphere. And one cannot hope to stand up to the them for long... at least not without steady hands at one's back.
17975,Valygar,Who are you that makes you so special? How do I know you are not lying to me?
17981,Valygar,"Wait! I've a proposal, if you are but willing to hear it!"
17992,Valygar,"I am the last of the Corthala line. That may mean little to you, but it means plenty to Lavok. When Lavok left Athkatla in the sphere, he was already many centuries old."
11597,Rielev,"Suspended, I be... I am... dying... dead. No matter, I must be your cruel dream as you are mine."
11598,Rielev,"Strangers be ye? Aaaa... things have gone... bad... since I have died. Threaten not the master, for you shall... surely... perish... Driven is he, and power he seeks..."
11622,Rielev,"Prisoners be ye? Truly I have been... dead, but not dead too long. I seek... release... I have been alone for... too long. The master can take nothing more... I am forgotten."
11626,Rielev,"Neither, neither. I am... between... the master has forgotten me... not killed me."
11631,Rielev,"Please! I am alone here. For too long, alone. If you must... escape... release me..."
11632,Rielev,Eternal... life... was to be my reward for faithful service. The master has suspended me until he can cure me... return my youth to me...
11785,Rielev,Release... yes! Master! Iâ€”I no longer wish to come back! Let me slip into the oblivion that has been denied me! Please!
11808,Rielev,He has forgotten because he does not wish to remember... what was taken... I barely remember myself.
11814,Rielev,"They may know how the master exits the complex. Will you take these cells to revive them and learn what you can, in return for this path to freedom I have offered ye?"
11842,Rielev,I thank ye... go and leave me to oblivion at last.
11843,Rielev,You are heartless. I again feel hate.
11846,Rielev,Leave me! Take the crystals and return me to oblivion!
17355,Rielev,"This... unit that contains me is powered by cells, by crystals. Take them and I can sleep... die... again die at last."
19951,Rielev,"I was a... faithful hound to the master. A friend, even. I was... dying... or dead, I cannot remember which. Truly you are a stranger to this place."
37848,Rielev,I thank thee. Go and leave me to oblivion at last. Sweet sleep...
37849,Rielev,You are heartless. I again feel hate.
2716,Yoshimo,"So, there is sanity in all this madness. If you are not in league with the evil that dwells in this unholy place, Yoshimo begs your assistance."
2722,Yoshimo,"I share your sentiments. I have seen much here that has disturbed me. I myself am a warrior with no evil intentions. Please, I would welcome any assistance you might offer."
2730,Yoshimo,"I am no fiend! I am Yoshimo! You know, Yoshimo?"
2734,Yoshimo,I do not know how long I was there before awaking.
2738,Yoshimo,I do not know a way to escape this place. Perhaps we could search for this exit together.
2741,Yoshimo,Perhaps then Yoshimo's predicament won't seem so funny!
2747,Yoshimo,"At last, an admirer! I do not know a way to escape this place. Perhaps we could search for this exit together."
2755,Yoshimo,What do you need to know?
2759,Yoshimo,"If you are ever in Athkatla and need some assistance, I reside at the Copper Coronet, an inn of some renown. First, however, a warning..."
2763,Yoshimo,You have changed your mind? Shall we draw our blades with a common purpose?
2770,Yoshimo,"I agree. Welcome to the Copper Coronet, my home here in Athkatla. What can Yoshimo offer you? Information? Contacts? Equipment? Perhaps you would like me to join you?"
2783,Yoshimo,"The barkeep's name is Bernard. He will sell you high-quality equipment at a reasonable price. If you have the time, though, I would suggest the Adventure Mart in the promenade."
2788,Yoshimo,I would be honored to wield my sword for you.
2789,Yoshimo,"Oh, taker of my honor, do not return to torment me further. Unless you have come to take back your cruel words, I ask you to leave now."
2792,Yoshimo,"Welcome to the Copper Coronet, my home here in Athkatla. What can Yoshimo offer you? Information? Contacts? Equipment? Perhaps you would like me to join you?"
4292,Yoshimo,It is good to see you again.
4349,Yoshimo,I did not hurt the nymph! She released me from the fairy circle. I am a free man again and ready to join your party.
4358,Yoshimo,"After the nymph released me, I ran to catch up with you and had a little run-in with a worg. The worg wounded me."
4362,Yoshimo,It is the truth! I would not harm that innocent nymph! She released me from the fairy circle so that I could rejoin my companions. You must believe me!
4366,Yoshimo,I am pleased to travel with you again.
4367,Yoshimo,I am very sorry to hear that. You shall find me in Athkatla should you need me. I will be staying at the Copper Coronet. Travel safely.
4368,Yoshimo,"When you have thought about this and realized your error, you will find me at the Copper Coronet in Athkatla. I will now take my leave of you."
18900,Yoshimo,"These little beasties keep coming in through the portals. Perhaps if the portals are destroyed, one could defeat the beasts that have already come through."
18902,Yoshimo,I have noticed that each wand is locked into the pedestal and could be removed if one had the proper key. I know not where these keys are. Let us begin!
20021,Yoshimo,"Shortly beyond that chamber, there is a hallway that contains several wands mounted in pedestals. They blast all that walk before them."
20022,Yoshimo,"It is actually quite uh... embarrassing. My profession does not leave itself open to those who are not wary, yet somehow I was caught unaware."
20023,Yoshimo,"I came to Athkatla years ago from Kara-Tur to seek my fortune. At some point, I went to bed in my room at the Copper Coronet, and I awoke in a strange room with a very sore head."
20024,Yoshimo,Maybe you should try to face the perils of this place alone!
20025,Yoshimo,"I am unsure. I may have been drugged when I was brought here. I may have been unconscious... either way, I do not know how long."
20030,Yoshimo,"If that is how you wish it to be, then go ahead and forge the trail. I will follow your path once I have rested a bit."
20058,Yoshimo,You do not know what happened! I must leave now before my anger rises any more.
20067,Yoshimo,"One more thing... you will find a wide hall before too long that contains several wands mounted on pedestals. If you walk before these wands, you may be killed."
20072,Yoshimo,"I am not sure how I came to be here... like you, I suspect. I have been trying to find my way out, but I was wounded in my attempt to do so."
20074,Yoshimo,"In the next chamber beyond the one in which we stand, four portals lie. Each of these portals releases a little cackling fiend which tries to kill me."
20082,Yoshimo,"In the next chamber beyond the one in which we stand, four portals lie. Each of these portals releases a little cackling fiend which tries to kill me."
20090,Yoshimo,"Shortly beyond that chamber, there is a hallway that contains several wands mounted in pedestals. They blast all that walk before them."
20103,Yoshimo,"In the next chamber, there are four portals. Each of these portals releases little cackling fiends which try to kill me."
