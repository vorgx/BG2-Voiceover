38543,Imoen,"Eww, I... really don't want to think about that too much."
38544,Imoen,I... I know this room. I've been in here... we both have. He... There are things in these tanks. They used to be people...
38559,Imoen,"What kind of monster is this guy? Captures us easy as pie, kills whoever he wants... that could have been us in those glass things."
38563,Imoen,"I don't know about that, Minsc, but he sure is a cute little fuzzy wuzzy. Aren't you, Boo?"
38584,Imoen,"We don't even know where we are, and my head is still doing funny things... He said something... something about potential."
38599,Imoen,"Are we? Horrible, horrible things surround us, and my head still hurts like crazy. I want to know what he did to me. I remember... something about potential."
38602,Imoen,He said it about you too: something about power that can be unleashed. I don't care; I just have to get out. Can we leave this room? It bothers me.
38603,Imoen,I want to know what he did to me too. My head still hurts really bad. He said... said something about potential... about you too.
38606,Imoen,"Wow, a golem. Powerful magic stuff. Odd that it's not hostile. I suppose its maker didn't expect us to escape, so it never got orders for restraining us."
38611,Imoen,"They only do exactly what they are directed to; they don't really think. If it hasn't been told to keep quiet, we might get some information out of it."
