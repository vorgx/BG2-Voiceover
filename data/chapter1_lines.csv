694,DRYAD,I can't wait.,,1,DRYAD
695,DRYAD,"I did say he was a necromancer, didn't I? As I understand it, Lavok felt that tampering with the veil that separates life from death was his prerogative.",VALYGA52,1,DRYAD
696,DRYAD,"The old family was, yes. They continued to practice Lavok's magics long after he left, but my particular branch was not interested in such pursuits.",,1,DRYAD
697,DRYAD,"They left in disgust, watching from afar as the old family crumbled over the years. And then my family inherited what little of Lavok's fortune was left.",,1,DRYAD
699,DRYAD,,,1,DRYAD
700,DRYAD,"Before you know it, you've spent your life in the library, having never seen the light of day, never truly lived. Believe me, I know this only too well.",,1,DRYAD
701,DRYAD,"Nalia, dearie, you remind me so much of Cletus Bifflelips, my second cousin, thrice removed.",JANJAN59,1,DRYAD
702,DRYAD,"You wouldn't think so, yet here we are. You see, Cletus had a propensity for bouts of violent projectile vomiting. We'd call him, Cletus the Room Clearer Bifflelips.",,1,DRYAD
703,DRYAD,"Now just bear with me for a moment, Nalia. You see, it was after one such bout that Cletus, feeling quite ill, took a painful stroll down to the local witch-woman, in the vague hope that she might have a cure for his problem.",,1,DRYAD
899,Jaheira,"Quickly! We must get out of here before whoever did this returns. I swear, traveling with you is never dull.",JAHEIR01,1,JAHEIRA
905,Jaheira,"No, we have traveled together too long for such games, and I will answer plain and true if it will help.",,1,JAHEIRA
906,Jaheira,"I will detail our relationship if you wish, but it shall be nothing you do not already know.",,1,JAHEIRA
907,Jaheira,"Have you forgotten what we have done? Perhaps your senses are addled. I will remind you, but it will not give any new clues as to why we are here.",,1,JAHEIRA
908,Jaheira,"I will recount what led to this if you wish, though I think I have little to offer that you do not know already.",,1,JAHEIRA
909,Jaheira,"I will repeat what I believe led to our capture if I must, but I doubt it shall prove to be different than what is already known by you.",,1,JAHEIRA
910,Jaheira,"At the behest of your slain foster father, my husband Khalid and I have kept an interest in you, though you have proven to be your own person in all things.",,1,JAHEIRA
911,Jaheira,******,,1,JAHEIRA
912,Jaheira,"Your... unique heritage has proven a magnet to adventure, for better or worse, and your foster father was right in directing us to watch over you.",,1,JAHEIRA
921,Jaheira,"Once we know, we will deal with them in due course, but for the time being, it is more important we retrieve our friends and companions and leave this place.",,1,JAHEIRA
926,Jaheira,"You, however, look as though you have been treated most unfavorably, and I should not like to think of Khalid receiving the same.",,1,JAHEIRA
935,Jaheira,Enough of this; we have no time to bicker. We must find any of our companions that are trapped here and escape.,,1,JAHEIRA
939,Jaheira,"Indeed? Well, despite your... wit, he would be a great help in our escape. Better that we make use of all our strengths, rather than pick apart our weaknesses.",,1,JAHEIRA
940,Jaheira,"You have changed in this place. You would abandon your friends? Whether you remember or not, we have shared the path here. Is that to be forgotten?",,1,JAHEIRA
945,Jaheira,"It would be best to face the culprit another day on our own terms, so go and be quick. We must free ourselves soon.",,1,JAHEIRA
955,Jaheira,Such callous disregard! We have fought together and traveled long! You would toss that aside like so much rubbish?,,1,JAHEIRA
956,Jaheira,"I neither understand nor appreciate such humor. If you are to effect my release, best you set to doing it.",,1,JAHEIRA
957,Jaheira,"Know you well that this will not be forgotten! You have turned as I thought you might, and will get what is deserved!",,1,JAHEIRA
958,Jaheira,"I do not recall you being so cold. Perhaps I have had some memory loss myself, but this will not be forgotten. If I live, I shall see you pay.",,1,JAHEIRA
959,Jaheira,"Do not get too close; if I could reach you, you would regret it.",,1,JAHEIRA
960,Minsc,Where? He who sneaks up on Minsc loses teeth!,MINSC47,1,BMINSC
961,Minsc,"Stop it! Boo is not for you, tiny! You'll hurt him!",,1,BMINSC
962,Minsc,"No, I know best when talking of Boo. If you could hear his wishes, you would agree, but you cannot. The words of Boo are for Minsc alone.",,1,BMINSC
963,Minsc,"I can and will. And another thing; no more sneaking Boo crackers. He is getting rather portly, and the crumbs make for an itchy bedroll.",,1,BMINSC
964,Minsc,"Eh, weather is nice... mmmaybe...",MINSC48,1,BMINSC
965,Minsc,*grunt*,,1,BMINSC
966,Minsc,What is too bad?,,1,BMINSC
967,Minsc,What do you mean?,,1,BMINSC
968,Minsc,An itch? Can you not scratch it?,,1,BMINSC
969,Minsc,"What can Minsc do to help? A tragedy, this is! I will slay those that need slaying!",,1,BMINSC
970,Minsc,"It is only fair, big-nosed little one. We will do all that we can to aid you.",,1,BMINSC
971,Minsc,You will not steal Boo from me! I know your tricks!,,1,BMINSC
972,Minsc,Boo shall comfort the little dying gnome for a moment. Only a moment!,,1,BMINSC
973,Minsc,"Alone? No, I draw the line... hey! Stand still! I warn you!",,1,BMINSC
974,Minsc,I'll throttle you with your own arms if you do not return him this instant! This is no longer amusing! It was never amusing! I am not laughing!,,1,BMINSC
975,Minsc,"That's right, you apologize! It's hard enough keeping Boo's roaming in check without you stealing him. Bad Jan! There will be a booting if this happens again!",,1,BMINSC
996,Jaheira,"You had best leave, and quickly. If I find my release from here, I will have your head on a pike! It will be as I should have done long ago!",,1,JAHEIRA
997,Jaheira,"Do you think me so weak of mind as to believe you, or so weak of spirit as to beg you? No, your choice is made clear and I will not indulge you further.",,1,JAHEIRA
1001,Jaheira,"And I have cause to believe this? I think not. Prove your intent by actually carrying out the deed, and then we shall see if I must kill you or not.",,1,JAHEIRA
1002,Jaheira,Do what you will. You have already proven as reliable as a tamed owlbear.,,1,JAHEIRA
1003,Jaheira,I shall see you again; you had best count on that. There will be blood that pays for your lies.,,1,JAHEIRA
1004,Jaheira,"Hello again, I see you have not had much luck. Do keep trying. We should leave this place as soon as we are able.",,1,JAHEIRA
1008,Jaheira,"I should hope so. If we stand about much longer, we are sure to be caught once more.",,1,JAHEIRA
1009,Jaheira,Do not think me overly domineering; I am just eager to leave. Please hurry.,,1,JAHEIRA
1010,Jaheira,"You have my gratitude, but I'll not look at you the same way again. You should not indulge that side of yourself. It does not honor the memory of Gorion.",,1,JAHEIRA
1015,Jaheira,"So be it. I thank you for my ""rescue."" If we meet again, I doubt it will be as pleasant as this. Take care; you've certainly chosen a rocky path.",,1,JAHEIRA
1016,Jaheira,"I must go. I think it is best that I leave before our host returns. Perhaps we will meet again, and perhaps it will be under favorable terms. I doubt it.",,1,JAHEIRA
1017,Jaheira,"No matter, as I will not be put off so easily. I will join and follow as you see fit. See that we do not stray too far afield lest I regret my decision.",,1,JAHEIRA
1018,Jaheira,"Perhaps we shall meet again, and perhaps we shall even both be on the side of right. Perhaps, though it does not look likely.",,1,JAHEIRA
1020,Jaheira,"I still believe you will choose the right path, and I shall be at your side while you do. I hope you do not disappoint, or make me regret my decision.",,1,JAHEIRA
1021,Jaheira,"Well, that is a relief, and about time too. We should be going immediately. Not only might our ""host"" come back, I simply must see the sun again in none too short a time. This dank place stifles me.",,1,JAHEIRA
1026,Jaheira,"As you would have it, though there are other friends we must find as well. It is good to share your company again.",,1,JAHEIRA
1027,Jaheira,"This place has hardened your manner. I do not remember you being so quick with a cold remark. Lead on as you wish, but do tread carefully, will you?",,1,JAHEIRA
1029,Jaheira,"I would disagree with your logic. Once noticed, would not smaller groups be more likely to be captured? There is safety in the company of friends.",,1,JAHEIRA
1033,Jaheira,"An effective plan, but as cold and calculating as the walls that hold us. So be it, but it won't be I that is captured. Perhaps we will meet again.",,1,JAHEIRA
1035,Jaheira,Kha... Khalid?,JAHEIRC3,1,JAHEIRAJ
1085,Jaheira,Khalid... No! This... this is an illusion... a dream... a bad dream...,JAHEIRC4,1,JAHEIRAJ
1090,Jaheira,"Sil... Silvanus guide the light... to the source. Take this man to what he justly deserves. By... nature's will, what was given is returned; what was turmoil is now... is now peace.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1092,Jaheira,We... we must hurry before we are noticed. We must get out of this... this grave... and seek the light above. Let us go.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
1117,Jaheira,"You will watch your tongue lest I rip it from your mouth! I, more than anyone, know of the ways life may return, but there is a line that cannot be crossed!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1118,Jaheira,"We live in a time of miracles, and nature allows the rebirth of many that have passed beyond the veil, but there is a time when... when it is better to let go.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1119,Jaheira,"I will mourn according to what I believe. His death... his death is horrible, but I am still trapped and we are still in danger. Should sorrow doom us all?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1136,Jaheira,"Nature is a cycle of birth and... death. Interrupting that cycle isn't... natural! Ah, there's no time for this! I will mourn, but we must still rescue ourselves!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1140,Jaheira,"That is the way of things. There will be... there will be payment for this crime, and I shall not rest until it is collected. When we are able, there will be...",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1144,Jaheira,Enough. I would leave this place.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
1147,Jaheira,"I will not suffer this! You will learn the limits and understand, but I will not bear this idiocy now! Find your own path; I will not travel with you!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1149,Jaheira,"You will learn. There are things that cannot change, and others that cannot remain. And others...",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1150,Jaheira,Another day! We must live to pose a bigger threat! There is no point joining the fray today; we would only end up dead or back in our cells. Another day...,,1,JAHEIRAJ
1152,Jaheira,"Of course I am afraid; what fool wouldn't be? We were captured with little difficulty, held with even less, and have escaped with friends dead or wounded.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1153,Jaheira,We will exact vengeance when it is to our advantage. I will not start a losing battle. A guaranteed loss is a fool's endeavor. Another day... another day...,,1,JAHEIRAJ
1159,Jaheira,"Only an idiot is not afraid when they should be. We were captured and held with ease! Yes, we have earned our freedom, but it was at the cost of our friends!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1160,Jaheira,Agreed. We will exact justice when we have hope of succeeding. Until then... I will not forget. Another time and place...,,1,JAHEIRAJ
1161,Jaheira,"I know this place... these buildings. Yes, that person was assuredly correct; this is Athkatla. We are in the state of Amn.",JAHEIRH3,1,JAHEIRAJ
1162,Jaheira,"No, Athkatla is along the lower edge of the Sword Coast. I wonder whom we angered that we should be brought here? We should lay low, perhaps in the slums.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1163,Jaheira,"Regardless, we will have to make sure we are out of sight for a while. I might know a few safe places here and there, by the docks or outside of town.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1169,Jaheira,"Whatever our enemy, we should keep low for a while. Perhaps at the docks or out of town. I might know a few places.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1172,Jaheira,"I would suggest the slums. There will be low-profile work, especially at the Copper Coronet. Someone might have heard of our capture or know where Imoen is.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1174,Jaheira,"You might have never been here, but I have. Those Who Harp tend to travel. Khalid... Khalid and I came here... well, let us just say I have been here before.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1186,Jaheira,"That would solve nothing, and would abandon Imoen to her fate. No, if we were captured before, then we can be captured again, so we must secure ourselves here.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1188,Jaheira,I... I am sorry? Do I know you?,JAHEIRD5,1,JAHEIRAJ
1191,Jaheira,"Forgive me, but I will require a little more information. Your name again?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1193,Jaheira,"No... no, I am terribly sorry, but your face is unfamiliar. Perhaps if you told me what you do...",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1195,Jaheira,"I remember well, but I wanted you to say it, and I wanted others to hear. Quite the outburst, Mister Ployer. I assume you are still at odds with your new life?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1197,Jaheira,"MISTER Ployer, I wanted you *dead* instead of merely humiliated! The courts did not seem to think death was warranted, so they claimed your assets instead.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1199,Jaheira,"He is none of your concern. If you value your teeth, you will not speak that name again. You dirty it.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1206,Jaheira,"Well, the slander is going a bit far. You actually were a slaver, you know. It's not slander if it's proven.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1209,Jaheira,"I don't think that word means what you think it means. You really were trading in slaves, you know? How am I libelous...?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1220,Jaheira,"What have you just done, Ployer? Speak!",JAHEIRH4,1,JAHEIRAJ
1222,Jaheira,"Nobody made you a slaver; you just loved the profit! Now you blame those that caught you because you cannot take responsibility? You are a weak, weak man!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1224,Jaheira,"By the horns of Silvanus, I'll plant him beneath the Stones of Aisath if I... if I...",JAHEIRH5,1,JAHEIRAJ
1228,Jaheira,"No, I... I'm fine. I just felt a little strange for a moment. That... that fat excuse for a slaver, he's cursed me! Damn him!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1232,Jaheira,"Try not to shout, please? My head is unsettled at the moment. There... it clears somewhat, but undoubtedly there will be more. That fat old slaver cursed me!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1238,Jaheira,"For the moment, though I do feel a touch under the weather. Damn him! I'll see his slaving heart stopped for this!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1243,Jaheira,"I doubt he would have bothered if the cure were quite so simple. If this curse was tailored to me, then we've no recourse but to exact its cure from his hide.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1244,Jaheira,"The Harpers do not operate like that. No, I bet only the one who cast it can remove it. It likely resists conventional means if it was tailored to me.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1245,Jaheira,I beg your pardon? I am to be cast out because of this? What is your reasoning?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
1246,Jaheira,"That may be my only option. If it was tailored to me, it might resist removal by normal means. I doubt Ployer would have done this if the solution were simple.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1275,Jaheira,"I have a few options. Ployer mentioned that he lived in squalor, suggesting he may be in the poor section of the city. Not likely to find him quick though.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1276,Jaheira,"He also mentioned Belgrade, a merchant that helped expose Ployer. He frequents the Copper Coronet, and the bartender Bernard might know his whereabouts.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1277,Jaheira,"He also mentioned Belgrade, a merchant that helped expose Ployer. He frequents the Copper Coronet, and the bartender Bernard might know his whereabouts.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1282,Jaheira,"True, there is a lot of ground to cover, but it seemed clear that he lives in squalor. I would begin in the poor sections of the city. It will take some time.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1283,Jaheira,Again this side of you surfaces. I should not have believed your apologies in Irenicus's dungeon. I will not spend a... *cough*... a moment more in your company!,,1,JAHEIRAJ
1284,Jaheira,"You *cough* surprise me. To think this cold streak was within and I had only glimpsed it until now. Well then, I will cause you no more inconvenience.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1287,Jaheira,"That is not *cough* amusing, and it's not the first time you have acted such. Perhaps you are colder than you let on, but I have little choice but to follow.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1288,Jaheira,There is always a better path than simply abandoning those that are weak. You will not keep allies by demonstrating that you are willing to sacrifice them.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
1289,Jaheira,"Very well, though I should like to try and find Belgrade eventually. It has been... *cough*... it has been some time since we talked.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1290,Jaheira,A good first step. Hopefully he can give us some idea where Ployer might... *cough*... might be.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
1291,Jaheira,,,1,JAHEIRAJ
1327,Jaheira,Ooohhh... mm! I did not find resting at all comfortable last eve. I... *cough*... I just couldn't bring my eyes to close. My head pounds as thunder behind my temples.,JAHEIRH6,1,JAHEIRAJ
1332,Jaheira,"Aye, that I am, but well enough to walk. I will see that Ployer pay for this. Blasted slaver!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1333,Jaheira,"I am rested well enough. I will not coddle this curse. Sleeping may ease the aching, but it won't help remove it. Only finding that Ployer will do that.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1334,Jaheira,"Lazy, am I? I wouldn't wish a wasting on many, but you come close. Ah, I have no time to bicker. We must continue on lest this affliction progress too far.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1335,Jaheira,"I see. So despite assurances, you are indeed the bastard I thought you were after that stunt in Irenicus's jail. Oh, I remember, and I'll remember this too.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1338,Jaheira,"Do not joke so! I am in grave straits, and you mock my condition with talk of leaving?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1343,Jaheira,You can get me Ployer. Never have I been so mad at another living thing. All this because he could not admit responsibility. He is irredeemable.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
1344,Jaheira,,,1,JAHEIRAJ
1346,Jaheira,"I see. Then I will waste no more of your time. I will seek help on my own, and damn you for being so cold. Farewell. We will not meet again.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1347,Jaheira,"My very bones ache today. It is as though I age on the inside. Ohh, this cannot go on for long.",JAHEIRC7,1,JAHEIRAJ
1353,Jaheira,"Oh, I shall certainly save it. I shall save it just long enough to bring the fury of Mother Earth upon that fat slaver that would imprison her children.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1355,Jaheira,,,1,JAHEIRAJ
1358,Jaheira,What do you mean by that? Am I not worth the effort of rescue? Have you better things to do?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
1371,Jaheira,,,1,JAHEIRAJ
1372,Jaheira,"Forgive my outburst as well; I am... *cough*... I am not myself. Come, we must go. I will see that slaver pay for this.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1486,Jaheira,Despicable... *cough* *cough*... despicable wretch! You knew I would come here?,JAHEIRD6,1,JAHEIRAJ
1489,Jaheira,"I am... I am not here to grovel, Ployer. You would sooner get that from my corpse!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1491,Jaheira,"I- *COUGH* I AM NOT HERE TO GROVEL! I may be weak, even dying, but you WON'T get that! I have come to take what is mine! I (ehrm) will be free of you... of your...",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1508,Jaheira,"I feel... weak, but better. I... *cough* *cough*... I thank you for helping me through this. You have earned my gratitude and... ehh... and I should really get a full day of rest.",JAHEIRC8,1,JAHEIRAJ
1513,Jaheira,"Ahh, yes, I'm the one with enemies we need to worry about. Do you even believe that yourself? Don't make me lau... ow... laugh.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1514,Jaheira,"I certainly hope so. Such weakness... I swear, if I meet his like again, I'll not let the courts spare him. I'll... I'll be better after a night's rest.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1515,Jaheira,"Like him? No. Well, perhaps, though he was certainly one of the more wretched. I doubt we'll see any more like him, though we'll never want for enemies.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1516,Jaheira,*yawn*... I'm... I live to see the Earthmother's dawn once more? Then... then you have succeeded. Excellent. And Ployer? What of him?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
1521,Jaheira,Indeed. I am glad to be rid of his foul curse. Odd bit of magic that. Onward then. I am fit for travel.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
1522,Jaheira,"I am, I am. With luck, we shall not meet the like of him again. With luck.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1523,Jaheira,There is no need to get excited. I am sorry to have caused such trouble. I shall just die outright in the future. Do not say a word. Let us go.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
1524,Jaheira,Good riddance. It was years overdue. Most of his ilk in my past suffered a more final version of Harper justice. Let us go; I have sat about too long.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
1525,Jaheira,"The mages with him wore odd colors that might be traceable. Ask at the government building, as all magic is regulated in Athkatla. If they will talk...",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1653,Jaheira,No deals for a slayer of Harpers.,JAHEIRC9,1,JAHEIRAJ
1656,Jaheira,"I'm... I'm fine, Bernard. I just need...",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1658,Jaheira,"Bernard, I'm FINE. I just need... need some information. I need to find Belgrade.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1661,Jaheira,"BERNARD! Bernard, this is important. I need to contact him. I know you can connect with the network when you need to, so...",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1663,Jaheira,D... dead? When?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
1665,Jaheira,"Bernard, please. I need to know where they found Belgrade. I also need to know if you have seen Baron Ployer.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1667,Jaheira,"I see... Thank you, Bernard. I... I really must be going now.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1689,Jaheira,"Drenden, I... I am dying.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1691,Jaheira,No arguments from... from me.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
1693,Jaheira,"Drenden, they have done nothing to me... I am... cursed. It cannot be removed. I cannot... I feel...",,1,JAHEIRAJ
1695,Jaheira,It's... all right. Find... find Ployer and...,,1,JAHEIRAJ
2093,Minsc,"Boo says fight hard, so I fight hard.",MINSC46,1,BMINSC
2095,Minsc,Space hamsters are never wrong!,,1,BMINSC
2306,Minsc,AHHHH! Minsc will be free! These bonds will not hold my wrath! Butts will be liberally kicked in good measure!,MINSC01,1,MINSCA
2364,Minsc,Time is short for talk that is small! Release me! I will rain beatings down upon all who have dared touch me and... and... Dynaheir! She will be avenged!,,1,MINSCA
2373,Minsc,NO! No control! No mercy! I will avenge... avenge... Dynaheir!,,1,MINSCA
2381,Minsc,"I know not who has done this, but I will avenge most viciously the wrongs they... the wrongs... Dynaheir! I will cave their skulls for what they have done!",,1,MINSCA
2382,Minsc,"I will continue my adventures with you, and... and... those that do evil will pay dearly for their actions! So swears Minsc! On Dynaheir's grave, so swear I!",,1,MINSCA
2383,Minsc,I will exact penance from each and every wicked soul that dared lay a finger on...,,1,MINSCA
2384,Minsc,"Will you help? We must join together once more, and our fury will be such that bards will run their quills dry! Yes, ink will be scarce where'er we go!",,1,MINSCA
2411,Minsc,"Trapped? Her spirit... her spirit is trapped in a cage created by my failure. I was to guard her, but she... she...",,1,MINSCA
2486,Minsc,"Boo points, I punch! Is very simple relationship, but it is effective.",MINSC49,1,MINSCJ
2524,Minsc,"Reconsider! I will rage as never before, and those in my path will fall left, right, and 'round the back! Dynaheir is... she is dead, and I will not rest...",,1,MINSCA
2525,Minsc,"If anything, I shall be even more single-minded in my focus! Minsc is Minsc, and it shall always be so. Come, Boo, we are among friends again!",,1,MINSCA
2530,Minsc,"Come, we must go now. Yes, Minsc and Boo and you, together again. Beware villains! I will force justice down your evil, evil throats!",,1,MINSCA
2531,Minsc,"You are filth... that I called friend! Do not make me add your ass to the kicking list! I would do so reluctantly, but I will do it! Choose your path now!",,1,MINSCA
2534,Minsc,"You lie! You freed yourself, and now you will not free me! Such villainy! Boo sees what you are doing!",,1,MINSCA
2540,Minsc,"Come, Boo, we must go! What? Yes, of course. My hamster says he will miss you. Such loyalty you inspire, even in rodents. Be proud, as Minsc is.",,1,MINSCA
2547,Minsc,"Minsc and Boo are Minsc and Boo, and we shall not be separated. Shall we go? The butts of evil await my bootprint!",,1,MINSCA
2550,Minsc,"Boo is the best purchase I ever made, and despite my head wound I could tell that his previous owner was good and honest. Boo is an asset to us all!",,1,MINSCA
2564,Minsc,"I have lost myself in your words, but Boo thinks you're just ducky. Onward!",,1,MINSCA
2632,Minsc,We do good things here! All will remember the heroes that are Minsc and Boo and you!,MINSC78,1,MINSCJ
2648,Minsc,"Nonsense! All enjoy the sight of heroes. We'll be the talk of the town for days! Wave to the nice people, Boo. Wave to the nice hamster, people. WAVE!",,1,MINSCJ
2650,Minsc,"Yes! Lead evil by example, and one day we need no longer put the boots to those that stray off the path of goodness into the muck and bile of villainy and track great bloody footprints across our lily-white tiles! Boo will have clean wood shavings, you evil bastards!",,1,MINSCJ
2651,Minsc,"Good has no need of low profiles! There is no shame in boasting if one follows through, and I am not about to keep my voice low! Perhaps Boo will, but not I!",,1,MINSCJ
2669,Minsc,"We follow the path that surely leads to glory! Boo is proud to be here, I can tell.",MINSC79,1,MINSCJ
2674,Minsc,"Then say it louder! We must inspire fear in evil! Quiet tales of hamsters are foolish, but a man and his hamster that tear evil limb from limb? That's scary!",,1,MINSCJ
2676,Minsc,"Now you are speaking the language of Minsc! Next we must get you a hamster! Or perhaps an ice weasel, whatever your tastes.",,1,MINSCJ
2677,Minsc,It's good that I know you are kidding. I would hate to have to cleanse my own party of evil. Always strive to be on the safe end of the justice boot.,,1,MINSCJ
2678,Minsc,"I know I think clearly because Boo tells me so. That is enough for me, though it never seems to be enough for anyone else. Their loss, for I am content.",,1,MINSCJ
2682,Minsc,"As long as some are scared and tell the rest, that is all that matters. Come, we must press on against the tide of naughtiness. Mind your step.",,1,MINSCJ
2683,Minsc,"I don't understand the reference, but Boo enjoyed it. An omen of good things... or of horrible and humorous death, I am not sure which.",,1,MINSCJ
2684,Minsc,These acts will place our names in the songs of skalds and bards from here to my home! There can be no doubt.,MINSC80,1,MINSCJ
2685,Minsc,I will not tolerate actions such as this! We should strive to be just and fair.,MINSC81,1,MINSCJ
2689,Minsc,"When making a glorious egg dish of goodness, I understand some eggs must be broken. But actions such as this are... simply deplorable!",MINSC82,1,MINSCJ
2693,Minsc,"Words are just loud air. Actions must take priority in my mind. A phrase might cause some discomfort, but it is good deeds that cause evil the most pain.",,1,MINSCJ
2694,Minsc,"That is all that can be asked. A crusade might be better, but few have the focus required. I will be the example if anyone wishes to follow in my wake.",,1,MINSCJ
2695,Minsc,"A hero needs no profit. A sword is just a few coins; armor is only a few more. No, it is evil that needs gold to fund their machinations, not heroes.",,1,MINSCJ
2696,Minsc,"I, uh... I could use a bit of a lie-down... lest I drop Boo on the battlefield. Have we a healer near?",MINSC83,1,MINSCJ
2700,Minsc,"Yes, that would be best. I should not like evil to get the jump on a weakened Minsc. We must be at our best for the fight to come.",,1,MINSCJ
2701,Minsc,Minsc is no weakling! I have survived more than you could bear! It is just unwise to let wounds go untreated! Enemies will find their work half done already!,,1,MINSCJ
2702,Minsc,"I know this, but Boo worries.",,1,MINSCJ
2703,Minsc,Ugh! We must rest and get healthy. It would not do for us to be caught unsuspecting with Minsc in this kind of shape.,MINSC84,1,MINSCJ
2704,Minsc,I do not get through many battles without injury. Why is Minsc always on the front line taking damage?,MINSC85,1,MINSCJ
2713,Minsc,"Perhaps I am a touch quick to combat, but I temper my temper with common sense about who I should attack. What? I do too! Why does Boo snicker?",,1,MINSCJ
2716,Yoshimo,"So, there is sanity in all this madness. If you are not in league with the evil that dwells in this unholy place, Yoshimo begs your assistance.",YOSHIM01,1,YOSHIMO
2717,Minsc,"If I protect more people by being at the forefront, then so be it! I shall charge in an instant and make my enemies sorry they were born as bad as they are!",,1,MINSCJ
2722,Yoshimo,"I share your sentiments. I have seen much here that has disturbed me. I myself am a warrior with no evil intentions. Please, I would welcome any assistance you might offer.",,1,YOSHIMO
2730,Yoshimo,"I am no fiend! I am Yoshimo! You know, Yoshimo?",,1,YOSHIMO
2734,Yoshimo,I do not know how long I was there before awaking.,,1,YOSHIMO
2735,Minsc,"If that is what you think, then you do not know Minsc. I never cower! Boo does, but he fears being underfoot. I do not! I am the over-foot placing evil at end-of-boot!",,1,MINSCJ
2738,Yoshimo,I do not know a way to escape this place. Perhaps we could search for this exit together.,,1,YOSHIMO
2740,Yoshimo,"These little beasties keep coming in through the portals. Perhaps if the portals are destroyed, one could defeat the beasts that have already come through.",,1,YOSHIMO
2741,Yoshimo,Perhaps then Yoshimo's predicament won't seem so funny!,,1,YOSHIMO
2744,Yoshimo,"You must be new to Amn, or at least Athkatla.",,1,YOSHIMO
2747,Yoshimo,"At last, an admirer! I do not know a way to escape this place. Perhaps we could search for this exit together.",,1,YOSHIMO
2751,Yoshimo,"If it was the former, this place could be anywhere. If it was the latter, then I don't imagine that I could have traveled very far without noticing.",,1,YOSHIMO
2755,Yoshimo,What do you need to know?,,1,YOSHIMO
2759,Yoshimo,"If you are ever in Athkatla and need some assistance, I reside at the Copper Coronet, an inn of some renown. First, however, a warning...",,1,YOSHIMO
2761,Yoshimo,I shall survive by taking the wise path. Go ahead and forge the trail. I will follow your path once I have rested a bit.,,1,YOSHIMO
2762,Yoshimo,I shall be happy to lend my blade to your cause. There are two things that I have discovered about this place that may help us escape.,,1,YOSHIMO
2763,Yoshimo,You have changed your mind? Shall we draw our blades with a common purpose?,,1,YOSHIMO
2766,Yoshimo,"Ah, my desperate, imprisoned friends! You are still alive and enjoying Athkatla's bounty, I see.",YOSHIM62,1,YOSHIMO
2770,Yoshimo,"I agree. Welcome to the Copper Coronet, my home here in Athkatla. What can Yoshimo offer you? Information? Contacts? Equipment? Perhaps you would like me to join you?",,1,YOSHIMO
2774,Minsc,"If you don't care about your party, then it will be you that is left on the battlefield eventually! I can only fight as long as I have my health...",,1,MINSCJ
2775,Yoshimo,"There is no need to hurt Yoshimo's delicate feelings. You have dishonored me before these drunkards, thieves, and gamblers. I may never live this down.",,1,YOSHIMO
2776,Yoshimo,Come back and see me when you have more time.,,1,YOSHIMO
2777,Yoshimo,I know of nothing specific here. I would talk to others in this place... adventure always finds its way here. The docks is also an interesting place to find work.,,1,YOSHIMO
2783,Yoshimo,"The barkeep's name is Bernard. He will sell you high-quality equipment at a reasonable price. If you have the time, though, I would suggest the Adventure Mart in the promenade.",,1,YOSHIMO
2788,Yoshimo,I would be honored to wield my sword for you.,,1,YOSHIMO
2789,Yoshimo,"Oh, taker of my honor, do not return to torment me further. Unless you have come to take back your cruel words, I ask you to leave now.",YOSHIM61,1,YOSHIMO
2792,Yoshimo,"Welcome to the Copper Coronet, my home here in Athkatla. What can Yoshimo offer you? Information? Contacts? Equipment? Perhaps you would like me to join you?",,1,YOSHIMO
3022,Minsc,"Boo is a fine friend, and powerful in ways you don't let yourself see! To insult Boo is to insult all things small that try hard. Oh, and Minsc as well.",,1,MINSCJ
3076,Minsc,Minsc and Boo and you! There can be no greater a team in all the realms!,,1,MINSCP
3144,Minsc,"Boo likes the forest, but Minsc? Oh, every time Boo plays in the leaves, Minsc has to give him another bath.",,1,BMINSC
3148,Minsc,"Of course he does, and it makes him squirm so much that I fear losing him. If he got loose... I worry what such a powerful creature would do if left unchecked.",,1,BMINSC
3150,Minsc,"Aye, and when we face a foe, I shall show them his pointy teeth!",,1,BMINSC
3151,Minsc,"Minsc has had the pleasure of standing next to many a warrior in battle, but I swear, I have never been as impressed as I am with you, Mazzy.",MINSC51,1,BMINSC
3153,Minsc,"Minsc does not insult those that fight with honor on the side of right! You may not be as big as Minsc, but very few are.",,1,BMINSC
3157,Minsc,"You are a sight in battle, young Mazzy! Boo has keen interest in the small, and Minsc takes great joy in the honor of combat, hehe, so you are doubly worthy of our company.",MINSC52,1,BMINSC
3159,Minsc,"I could not be more so! Don't look for subtle messages, I keep nothing hidden. I help the weak and leave evil in my boot print. You are similar... Boo can tell.",,1,BMINSC
3162,Minsc,"Arrgh! Minsc could use a healing touch. Oh, poor Boo; the sight of blood does make him tremble so.",MINSC53,1,BMINSC
3164,Minsc,"You would seek the path of paladin? A difficult road, and you will find many barriers that sword will not break.",,1,BMINSC
3166,Minsc,"Ahh, Boo, Minsc has placed his feet where his head should go once more. No, Mazzy, I meant only that it is a path that is difficult regardless.",,1,BMINSC
3169,Minsc,"You are more like Boo than Minsc. Boo is small, but he is more than people would believe. Evil will see you like they see Boo, and that will help you in the end.",,1,BMINSC
3171,Minsc,NOOO! Such a vile act will not go unpunished! Minsc will see this paladin's heart avenged! And Boo shall burrow through your black little souls!,MINSC54,1,BMINSC
3172,Minsc,"Mazzy! You walk with the living once more! Minsc was so scar... uh... well... Boo! Boo was so scared you were lost to us, but miracles have brought you back!",,1,BMINSC
3175,Minsc,"Of course, brave little one. See, Boo, she is well and as she was. You were foolish to have been worried. Yes... you were.",,1,BMINSC
3179,Minsc,"Ahh, this land is fine... but I wish I could show Boo the fields of Rashemen. We could run free through the snow... ah, though Boo would look some kind of funny in a drift, I tell you this. Ha ha!",MINSC66,1,BMINSC
3182,Minsc,"No, it is as real as Minsc, though even larger! It lies far in the direction of the sun at morning. Ah, but it has been long since I left it.",,1,BMINSC
3184,Minsc,"I was on my dajemma, a journey to prove my manhood! Oh, we were a pair, me and my witch! I was to watch over Dynaheir and bring her home in... in safety.",,1,BMINSC
3186,Minsc,"You have been good friends, you and you... Minsc would ask something! Will you be my witch, Aerie? Boo and I are nothing without a witch...",,1,BMINSC
3188,Minsc,"My sword, my soul, my hamster... all of these I pledge to... to Aerie, my witch... HEAR THAT, EVIL? MINSC HAS A NEW WITCH! WOE IS YOU!",,1,BMINSC
3190,Minsc,"You are okay, Aerie?... Boo tried his best to save you.",MINSC55,1,BMINSC
3191,Minsc,"Wine, everyone! Song! The witch lives!",,1,BMINSC
3194,Minsc,"Boo wishes you well, young Mazzy. Minsc does too. May evil fear your bootfall wherever you tread.",,1,BMINSC
3196,Minsc,All will fall before the might of Minsc and Boo! Evil all about! All will... FAAARRRRGHHH!,MINSC56,1,BMINSC
3200,Minsc,I will fight! Minsc fights and evil falls!,,1,BMINSC
3202,Minsc,I will... I... Keldorn?,,1,BMINSC
3205,Minsc,"RRRAAAAGH! KILL, SAYS BOO! KILL, DOES MINSC!",MINSC57,1,BMINSC
3207,Minsc,"Raaagh! Ra... Minsc... Minsc is... better now. Boo calms as we speak. Thank you, paladin.",,1,BMINSC
3209,Minsc,"Minsc is calm. Boo is calm. You are wise in your words and bear your weapon well. Would that you could hear Boo's praise, for my own words do not suffice.",,1,BMINSC
3212,Minsc,Who wants a piece of Minsc? Who? Evil will die here! Enemies everywhere!,MINSC58,1,BMINSC
3214,Minsc,Friends... my friends...,,1,BMINSC
3217,Minsc,"Minsc calms... you are right... Thank you, Keldorn. You are... an inspiration to me.",,1,BMINSC
3221,Minsc,"You bear the wounds of battle well, Keldorn. A warrior of your ability would be well respected in my home of Rashemen.",MINSC59,1,BMINSC
3225,Minsc,"This, Boo, this is a hero of legend! Minsc is honored to fight at your side, Keldorn!",,1,BMINSC
3235,Minsc,"Yet more scars that show Minsc's prowess in battle! All great warriors wear such marks. Keldorn, you must have a great many scars that are your medals of combat! Do you wear them proudly, as Minsc does?",MINSC60,1,BMINSC
3237,Minsc,"I did not think of it that way, though scars are my proof that I will fight evil to the last. It places fear in the hearts of the enemy.",,1,BMINSC
3239,Minsc,"I can respect that, though I would rather my enemies know I am coming and that there is little they can do.",,1,BMINSC
3240,Minsc,No! For such a warrior to fall here is an abomination! And I do not even know the word! All will feel my boot to head for this!,MINSC61,1,BMINSC
3241,Minsc,"Oh, your legacy did not die! You are with us again! Oh, Boo is positively vibrating with happiness! Minsc will not let such evil claim you again!",MINSC62,1,BMINSC
3243,Minsc,"I do not like to think of those I have lost as gone. I may not speak of them much, but they are in each swing of my sword as I avenge them!",,1,BMINSC
3247,Minsc,"Ah! Minsc... *pant* Minsc breathes! Boo! Where is Boo? Oh, there you are. You did not leave me. A miracle is this!",MINSC63,1,BMINSC
3252,Minsc,And Boo would have it no other way! Minsc lives. Beware evil!,,1,BMINSC
3253,Minsc,"Cernd, you are akin to nature as I am. Why did you not take up the blade to fight? I do not think I would have the patience you do in battle.",MINSC67,1,BMINSC
3264,Minsc,"Confused looks from all sides, but Minsc understands!",,1,BMINSC
3267,Minsc,"Flowers are beautiful, aren't they, Boo? I wish there were more to see.",MINSC68,1,BMINSC
3270,Minsc,"I don't understand much that is complicated, but the trees and the flowers are music to my eyes. Boo prefers the calm of the forest, though he suffers my company.",,1,BMINSC
3283,Minsc,"No, he is my hamster. You talk in circles, Cernd, but that's okay. Boo runs in them.",,1,BMINSC
3298,Minsc,"You are not as serious as many druids I have met, Cernd. Some even disapprove of me because I am... I am... I'd... hmm... I don't really know why. Boo will not tell me either.",MINSC69,1,BMINSC
3317,Minsc,"You could just say you don't know. Boo makes more sense, and he does not have thumbs.",,1,BMINSC
4292,Yoshimo,it is good to see you again.,,1,YOSHIMO
4300,Yoshimo,NO! I did not kill her!,,1,YOSHIMO
4310,Yoshimo,"She, uh, released me from bondage. I am a free man again and ready to rejoin your party.",,1,YOSHIMO
4343,Yoshimo,"Please, do not be angry with me. The nymph enchanted me, but she has since freed me. I am a free man again and ready to rejoin your party.",,1,YOSHIMO
4349,Yoshimo,I did not hurt the nymph! She released me from the fairy circle. I am a free man again and ready to join your party.,,1,YOSHIMO
4358,Yoshimo,"After the nymph released me, I ran to catch up with you and had a little run-in with a worg. The worg wounded me.",,1,YOSHIMO
4362,Yoshimo,It is the truth! I would not harm that innocent nymph! She released me from the fairy circle so that I could rejoin my companions. You must believe me!,,1,YOSHIMO
4366,Yoshimo,I am pleased to travel with you again.,,1,YOSHIMO
4367,Yoshimo,I am very sorry to hear that. You shall find me in Athkatla should you need me. I will be staying at the Copper Coronet. Travel safely.,,1,YOSHIMO
4368,Yoshimo,"When you have thought about this and realized your error, you will find me at the Copper Coronet in Athkatla. I will now take my leave of you.",,1,YOSHIMO
5009,DRYAD,Hold Undead,,1,DRYAD
5036,DRYAD,I think that goes without saying.,NALIA50,1,DRYAD
5037,DRYAD,"If I had wanted your tutelage, surely I would have asked for it!",,1,DRYAD
5038,DRYAD,"I know, Yoshimo. I'm not angry with you, really... I'm just nervous. I would feel very guilty if I set off a trap by accident.",,1,DRYAD
5039,DRYAD,I will try not to disappoint.,,1,DRYAD
5040,DRYAD,"Tell me, how did you get into adventuring? It is a dangerous business, as you well know. Any one of us could die without even a moment's notice.",YOSHIM58,1,DRYAD
5041,DRYAD,I did not so much get into adventuring as it was forced upon me.,,1,DRYAD
6940,Minsc,"Boo does not understand. It is not as though the scoundrel will be missed, but... where has Edwin gone, and who is this woman that wears his clothes?",MINSC70,1,BMINSC
6987,Minsc,"Such a temperament! Fire in her belly and not afraid to spit in an eye! It reminds me of the fighting women of my homeland! Ah, sweet lady, you bring me tears.",,1,BMINSC
7030,Minsc,"You bear handsome features, uh... though... they are familiar too, uh... Edwin's sister, perhaps? Hehe. Ah yes, Boo sees the resemblance. You are far his superior in your manner though.",MINSC74,1,BMINSC
7043,Minsc,"I don't do well with the philosophical. You are Edwin? Ah, like Minsc is Boo and Boo is Minsc because we carry each other within. Do you like hamsters? Boo likes you.",,1,BMINSC
7065,Minsc,"I see more and more of Edwin in your tone, though still you are better company than he. Boo will forgive you for now.",,1,BMINSC
7069,Minsc,"I think she warms to our company, Boo. See how she looks longingly?",,1,BMINSC
7549,Minsc,"Your words are strange, wizard. Stranger still are the thoughts behind them. Er, stand back a step if you don't mind. Boo has expressed a dislike for your company, and I cannot say I am surprised...",MINSC71,1,BMINSC
7551,Minsc,"I am quite used to people mocking Boo. It no longer bothers either one of us. Laugh if you will, but Minsc hears what you cannot.",MINSC72,1,BMINSC
7554,Minsc,Opposite of... lesson... less on... more on! The opposite of less on is more on! More on? Do you dare to insult me once again?,,1,BMINSC
7559,Minsc,"The Red Wizard risks great harm. Boo is sensitive, and may not just go for the eyes!",MINSC73,1,BMINSC
7560,Minsc,"You pick at old wounds, wizard! Continue to press and I shall make you some fresh ones!",,1,BMINSC
7561,Minsc,"You are one step away from wearing your lips as a collar, wizard! Withdraw your foolish words!",,1,BMINSC
7562,Minsc,"Then you shall pay the price for your ""observations""! Those that speak ill of the dead shall join them! May you spend eternity with Dynaheir's foot in your loins!",,1,BMINSC
7905,Jaheira,"Think hard on this! This matter is near and dear my own heart, and it deserves due care and attention!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
8656,Minsc,"I do not like the tone of your voice, dark elf! The face I have is the face the ladies love! Boo loves Minsc's face, too. Don't you, Boo? Don't you? Yes!",MINSC44,1,BMINSC
9265,Minsc,Boo says that he was just doing his job.,MINSC50,1,BMINSC
9268,Minsc,"Boo says that Yoshimo did well, too... for someone who isn't Minsc.",,1,BMINSC

11354,IDRYAD1,Thank you! You must take the acorns and deliver them to the Fairy Queen in the south end of the Windspear Hills.,,1,IDRYAD1
11357,IDRYAD2,We will help you escape! You must use the portals to travel up to the next level of the complex. This is how Irenicus travels. The portals are triggered by a certain key.,,1,IDRYAD2

11421,IDRYAD3,Thank you! Here is the flask.,,1,IDRYAD3

14247,Minsc,No. I have had enough of tiny people trying to steal Boo. Away!,,1,MINSCJ
14311,Minsc,"Stupid is as stupid does, young one. So says Boo.",,1,MINSCJ
14332,Jaheira,"What is this ""clap"" you speak of, child? Enough. Begone, you are disturbing me.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
14496,Minsc,"No! Boo is NOT for eating! Boo is mighty and wise and probably quite stringy. Er, and he is my companion!",,1,MINSCJ
14533,Minsc,I am sorry. I am only for Boo and my witch.,,1,MINSCJ

14700,Jaheira,"I was wondering the same, though we are not all that far from home and organizations can span continents. Perhaps it is not an individual that seeks our heads.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
14706,Jaheira,I do not know the city well enough to give directions though. We will have to seek out the slums. Perhaps we may find who holds Imoen still.,,1,JAHEIRAJ

15407,Jaheira,Indeed. I am glad to be rid of his foul curse. Odd bit of magic that. Onward then. I am fit for travel.,,1,JAHEIRAP
15408,Jaheira,"I have you to thank, I assume. Of course I do. You have proven quite the friend. Shall we... continue our adventures? I believe I am fit for travel.",,1,JAHEIRAP
15409,Jaheira,I am sorry to have caused you all this trouble. I shall just have them kill me outright in the future. Do not say a word. Let us go.,,1,JAHEIRAP
15410,Jaheira,Good riddance. I should have done such years ago when I discovered him and his network. Harper justice for the wicked. Shall we go? I am fit for travel.,,1,JAHEIRAP
15461,Minsc,I am not impressed by fighting slaves. But I would CRUSH any true opponent who dared to face me!,,1,MINSCJ

15959,Minsc,You are coming from Rashemen? I remember it fondly and hope to take Boo to see it once I have completed my dajemma.,,1,MINSCJ
15960,Minsc,No. Boo is my hamster. And Boo is my friend.,,1,MINSCJ
16040,Jaheira,"Hail there! I said I would return, and I have. Sorry to have kept you waiting, but there were things I had to take care of. Now that we have met once again, there is something I must ask of you. We must go... we must go to the Harper Hold in Athkatla.",JAHEIRE3,1,JAHEIRAP
16092,Jaheira,"Do I know of you? Have you reason to subject me to your rude manner? I have no coin, if that is your wish.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
16093,Jaheira,I do not follow by a stranger's command. Who are you?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
16095,Jaheira,"I... Yes, I see. If you would give me a moment, I will do what needs be done.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
16097,Jaheira,"Relax, I will not be gone long. Please, I will explain when I return. I... I do not wish to be apart from you too long. I will return when I can.",,1,JAHEIRAJ

16212,Jaheira,"Thank you, I am glad to be back in your company. I only wish it were not under such circumstances. Come, we must go. I will explain more when it is time.",,1,JAHEIRAP
16433,Jaheira,Remember your obligations elsewhere. We have to go to the Harper Hold in Athkatla as soon as possible. It would not be good to keep them waiting too long.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
16434,Jaheira,"We should make our way to the Harper Hold in Athkatla as soon as we are able. I do not look forward to the trip any more than you do, but we must.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
16436,Jaheira,"Please, it is very important that we go to the Harper Hold in Athkatla. They were very insistent that I bring you there, and we must go soon.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
16577,Jaheira,"I am a Harper in my heart; you know this. It is my duty to bring you to them, but... but I no more want to make the trip than you do. Nevertheless, we must go.",,1,JAHEIRAJ

16580,Jaheira,"Harpers will wait an eternity for vengeance or justice, though defining the two is sometimes difficult. They made it clear I was to bring you to them.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
16583,Jaheira,"Please, do not make this difficult. I have a duty to take you, and I will not rest easy until we have gone. I will not force you, but eventually we must go.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
16764,Jaheira,"Your welcome is forced, Galvarey. You know I am here at the bidding of the Herald. Why have you come to greet me? This is too important to waste time on you.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
16795,Jaheira,You are no Herald! What is going on here?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
16803,Jaheira,I know you are an ambitious fool. You cannot be sanctioned to do this. Even this gaudy base is against our usual restraint. The position of Herald requires...,,1,JAHEIRAJ
16810,Jaheira,"Fine, set about with your questions so I can get on with my job as well.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
16835,Jaheira,Please.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
16838,Jaheira,"Galvarey, siblings we are in Harper blood, but if you do not cease your tongue, I shall remove it!",,1,JAHEIRAJ

17086,Jaheira,"You are twisting their words, Galvarey. That is not what they meant.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
17090,Jaheira,Why do you ask the question if you are going to infuse the answer with your own meaning? you would never...,,1,JAHEIRAJ
17094,Jaheira,Only in your mind. This is a farce!,,1,JAHEIRAJ
17177,Jaheira,This is a difficult situation! Would you react any different?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
17216,Jaheira,What has *that* to do with anything?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
17325,Jaheira,"And also the sky, or the ocean! You are so intent on seeing what you wish the answer does not matter!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
17337,Jaheira,"And also of apples, or the rose! You are so intent on seeing what you wish the answer does not matter!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
17341,Jaheira,"And also of the sun above, or the daisy! You are so intent on seeing what you wish the answer does not matter!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
17343,Jaheira,"And also of the grass, or the leaves in the trees! You are so intent on seeing what you wish the answer does not matter!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
17345,Jaheira,"And also of the night sky, or the coat of a fine steed! You are so intent on seeing what you wish the answer does not matter!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
17350,Jaheira,"Now you are really stretching! What of clouds that bring life to the soil, or the purity of undyed wool? You see what you wish; the answer does not matter!",,1,JAHEIRAJ

17433,Jaheira,"Thank you, but no. Tonight I am fine as I am.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
17441,Jaheira,"But you were to see you as they is, not as you expected them to be! I was to bring them here so...",,1,JAHEIRAJ
17449,Jaheira,"I am sorry, this was not my intent at all! I thought...",,1,JAHEIRAJ
17450,Jaheira,"Indeed, Galvarey, what is it you intend? This is not as we had discussed...",,1,JAHEIRAJ
17452,Jaheira,My... what? You are questioning me? You subject him to this... this witch hunt and you think I am the one that is to be questioned?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
17454,Jaheira,And what if they will restore the balance? What if their intent is good?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
17457,Jaheira,"As Harpers, we respect others!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
17459,Jaheira,"It is as good as death and you know it, Galvarey!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
17469,Jaheira,"Nay, Galvarey, there is but you and your four lackeys. I will have no part in this!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
17472,Jaheira,"I... I will stand by your side if you will have me. You are... you are better than this, I know. I...",,1,JAHEIRAJ
17475,Jaheira,"So... so be it, then. I will... I must not... I will have no part in either side of this!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
17477,Jaheira,These are no friends of mine! I do not recognize them!,,1,JAHEIRAJ
17479,Jaheira,"Harpers may interfere, but it is for the greater good! Not this! I don't know you!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
17480,Jaheira,you are my comrade in arms. I know you are good and true in heart. I will fight with you against this!,,1,JAHEIRAJ

17707,Jaheira,It is about time you returned; I have been waiting here for who knows how long! We'd best get back together and get moving; I'll not serve nature or my fallen comrades by sitting about here.,JAHEIRE4,1,JAHEIRAP

17713,Jaheira,Good and done. We should make all speed to our destination.,,1,JAHEIRAP
17714,Jaheira,"You have returned to my company, but I no longer know you. Tales of your deeds have spread before you... and the Harpers have kept certain tabs on you at all times. You will find no quarter here! Justice will take you!",JAHEIRE5,1,JAHEIRAP
17715,Jaheira,"I-I had hoped to see you again. I... ah, that is, it is good to see you well! I have heard good things... for the most part at least. Shall we team once more? You and I both have much left to do.",JAHEIRH9,1,JAHEIRAP
17735,Jaheira,"I will, but only as a comrade in arms. Perhaps there was a chance for more, but no longer. It is for the best; we have friends to avenge.",,1,JAHEIRAP
17737,Jaheira,"For... yes, for the sake of the group. We have friends to avenge and should get to it. Other... other things will wait. Yes, I will come with you.",,1,JAHEIRAP
17739,Jaheira,"Yes... yes, it is best to move on. I will be here or near here if you should change your mind, but I think we will always be separate in some measure now.",,1,JAHEIRAP

17807,Jaheira,"Bah! He was a fool bent on advancing his own station! His intent was to use you as a trophy, hoping to gain enough influence to become a Herald!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
17819,Jaheira,As you wish. Reviane is of interest because they is one of the Children. Galvarey wished to capitalize on the fear around the prophecies of old.,,1,JAHEIRAJ

18557,Jaheira,"I take strength from the group, but... more so in your company. I have friends to avenge, but life is also for the living. Life is worth pursuing. I... I hope you agree.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
18637,Jaheira,But... what?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
18639,Jaheira,"Not the way they tell it, Bernard. You know me, so trust in what I do.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
18654,Jaheira,"This group is yours to reform as you see fit, though dropping me for another does not seem like the wisest choice. I will abide by your decision though.",JAHEIRE9,1,JAHEIRAP
18760,Jaheira,"Jaheira is what I am called, as you should well know. We have traveled together for some time, and the places we have gone number too many to name.",,1,JAHEIRA
18763,Jaheira,"I cannot stay here, however. I will probably be in Athkatla, as the Harpers have a base of sorts within. If you can find it, that's where I'll be.",,1,JAHEIRAP
18767,Jaheira,"Perhaps... this will be for the best. I will try to find assistance from my fellow druids, southwest of Trademeet. They will be able to help, I am sure.",,1,JAHEIRAP
18770,Jaheira,"If you find Ployer in the meantime, be sure to kill him once for me. I would very much appreciate it.",,1,JAHEIRAP
18772,Jaheira,"This... this is unexpected. I had thought we were closer than simple group comrades. Not that I doubt you, but should I leave the group, I doubt things will be the same between us.",JAHEIRF1,1,JAHEIRAP
18776,Jaheira,"I do not wish to leave your... company. Certainly you must still want me around? You have said as much, even if not using those exact words.",,1,JAHEIRAP
18783,Jaheira,I am glad of this. I have... I have high hopes for what we will accomplish in the future.,,1,JAHEIRAP
18785,Jaheira,"You may, but it will not be the same. I will likely be in Athkatla, near the Harper Hold that is there. Take your time in finding me.",,1,JAHEIRAP
18788,Jaheira,"I see. If this is the way it shall be... I will probably be in Athkatla, near the Harper Hold. You may seek me there, though it matters little.",,1,JAHEIRAP
18793,Jaheira,"This is not wise. We should be making all haste to the Harper Hold in Athkatla. I... I do not look forward to the trip, so I will not force you to go, but it would be best if you complied.",JAHEIRF2,1,JAHEIRAP
18797,Jaheira,I will await your arrival at the Hold. They will have my assurances that you are on your way. Do not make a liar of me.,,1,JAHEIRAP
18798,Jaheira,I fear the actions of my fellow Harpers may have colored your view of me. I assure you I wish to be in no other place than by your side.,JAHEIRF3,1,JAHEIRAP
18819,Jaheira,Have I... have I made a mistake investing my time in you? I doubt I will see you in the same fashion if I can be cast aside as any other party member.,,1,JAHEIRAP
18824,Jaheira,I... I see. Then I was foolish. I will not... show such weakness again. I will be at the Harper Hold in Athkatla. I look forward... I will await you there.,,1,JAHEIRAP
18825,Jaheira,Then I will stay. Please do not suggest such things again. We must make haste to the Harper Hold in Athkatla. They will not wait forever.,,1,JAHEIRAP
18826,Jaheira,"I... I beg your pardon? I may have misheard your decision; you... you wish me to leave? But... I wish to be no other place than here, with... with you. I could not come back if I am wrong. Tell me you have misspoken.",JAHEIRF4,1,JAHEIRAP
18829,Jaheira,That is good to know. I have few others to turn to now and I... I value our time together.,,1,JAHEIRAP
18830,Jaheira,Curse me for a fool then. Why I thought... I will not show such weakness again. So be it; I will venture off on my own.,,1,JAHEIRAP
18831,Jaheira,I am not sure where I will go. Goodbye. I do not think we will meet again.,,1,JAHEIRAP
18832,Jaheira,What? You cannot mean- I stood by you through a very difficult time; I have turned my back on many of my own brethren! Am I to be cast aside like any other member of the group? I'm not sure I could return after something like this.,JAHEIRF5,1,JAHEIRAP
18835,Jaheira,"I thank you. I have a lot invested in this group, and I should not like to leave just yet.",,1,JAHEIRAP
18836,Jaheira,"I see. Well, I will not waste my breath arguing. I will go... I cannot go to the Harpers here. I will go... where? Goodbye, I doubt we shall meet again.",,1,JAHEIRAP

19455,Jaheira,Then do so. I wish this matter behind me once and for all.,,1,JAHEIRAJ

19699,Jaheira,I... I don't know.,,1,JAHEIRAJ

19765,Imoen,"You'd better make yourself ready right quick, you goon! Don't you remember getting dragged here?",,1,IMOEN10
19772,Imoen,I guess I can't blame you for forgetting. All I remember is us getting jumped near Baldur's Gate. It was quick...,,1,IMOEN10
19789,Imoen,"It must be because he's been messing with our heads. I don't remember much, but I know it... it hurt. I just have to get out of here.",,1,IMOEN10
19800,Imoen,"Come on, don't make me think of it. He did the same to you, I think. I heard you screaming like it, anyway.",,1,IMOEN10
19807,Imoen,"Yeah, me too, but my head hurts the most. Yours too by the sound of the screaming. We just have to get out of here.",,1,IMOEN10
19886,Imoen,"Later! I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I could get loose again if he came back! My head hurts so bad...",,1,IMOEN10
19915,Imoen,"It isn't like a normal pain. it's on the inside, like my bones made a little dagger and it won't go away.",,1,IMOEN10
19918,Imoen,"Good, because I don't know if I could get loose again if I had to. Not with the pain in my head...",,1,IMOEN10
19922,Imoen,There was fighting... my cell was damaged. I don't know if I could get out again. The pain in my head is getting worse.,,1,IMOEN10
19929,Imoen,"I don't think it's our gear. They probably sold our best stuff, but anything is better than nothing. Now let's go!",,1,IMOEN10

24877,Jaheira,I would say you are a fool trying to sell something you do not own and a wastrel attempting to take advantage of the innocent.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
24879,Jaheira,"It is because of dirt such as you that I do not like coming to the city. Do not speak to me again, criminal.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
25009,Minsc,"Nobody cheats Minsc! If somebody dares to cheat me, they are in for a boot-stomping adjustment to their moral value systems!",,1,MINSCJ
25066,Minsc,"Will you help me? We must join together once more, and our fury will be such that bards will run their quills dry! Yes, ink will be scarce where'er we go!",,1,MINSCA
25071,Minsc,I do not know either. The bars have no lock at all; they are smithed together. I am proud that they feared me enough to imprison me permanently!,,1,MINSCA
25092,Minsc,I know you will do it! I only travel with heroes!,,1,MINSCA
25093,Minsc,"I can't help it. Freedom is to be mine, and even my permanently welded cell will not deter you! Yes, no lock at all! They feared me that much, and I am proud!",,1,MINSCA
25097,Minsc,"You return! And with the means to rescue me, no doubt! Ho ho! I see hope in your face! Dirt mostly, but hope is there too!",MINSC75,1,MINSCA
25101,Minsc,"But you will keep looking, of course! You would never give up, I know this! A hero always succeeds, and a hero never stops short of their goal!",,1,MINSCA
25105,Minsc,You... have brushed me aside with your words. You won't help... Boo can see it now! You do not intend to cut my chains! You only intend to yank them!,,1,MINSCA
25106,Minsc,The bars! They bend and twist with my berserker strength! Minsc and Boo are free! Now you will n... now...,MINSC76,1,MINSCA
25107,Minsc,"Ooh! Ooooh... oh ho, you are a smart one! I understand now! You said what you did just to get me mad! Mad enough to break free! Ha ha! You are as smart as Boo sometimes!",MINSC77,1,MINSCA
25108,Minsc,"Now we can resume our adventures together! There are friends to avenge and villains to smack about the face and neck! Right, Boo?",,1,MINSCA
25320,Jaheira,What is this? Why do you exhibit such an unpleasant demeanor? What have my people done to deserve such hatred from you?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
25322,Jaheira,"I lead no one to evil, human. And we elves have reason to be proud... we are an old race, far older than you.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
25324,Jaheira,"You are a fool, human, and I've no reason to discuss anything with you further.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
25370,Minsc,I am always willing to help those in need! I will give your troubles the one-two boot-stomp of goodness!,,1,MINSCJ
25375,Minsc,"I sometimes feel lost, but Boo tells me where to go. Boo points, I punch! Well, Boo actually just kind of runs, but I still punch! Yes, sir!",,1,MINSCJ
25378,Minsc,"Boo knows everything and is ever so willing to help others. You... you are kind to animals, aren't you? Rodents in particular?",,1,MINSCJ
25380,Minsc,"Boo doesn't like rats either. Something about their tails makes him... edgy, and you don't know creepy until you've seen an edgy hamster!",,1,MINSCJ
25385,Minsc,"Yes, Boo is friend to all. Such greatness, packed into a small, furry bundle of goodness.",,1,MINSCJ
25452,Minsc,Eh? You are speaking of me? How do you know this?,,1,MINSCJ
25458,Jaheira,Are... are you speaking of me? And Khalid? How do you know of this? Answer me!,,1,JAHEIRAJ
25474,Jaheira,"Fellow prisoner that you must be, there is no time for idle chatter. Get you so we can work on getting out. I have to talk to them.",,1,JAHEIRA
25517,Imoen,"Come on! I'll drag you out of here if I have to, just so long as we get out! I can't go through any more.",,1,IMOEN10
25518,Imoen,"Don't look at me like that. It just hurts, all right? Must have been the noise. There was a fight... assassins came after our captor, I think.",,1,IMOEN10
25589,Minsc,"No. I do not act. I fight, and fight for real.",,1,MINSCJ
25600,Jaheira,"You should be careful, woman... you might miss him more than you think should your wish come true.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
25615,Jaheira,"Not all elves are ""flighty""... in their many years, they learn all too well the responsibilities and pitfalls of this world. You would do well to remember that.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
25649,Minsc,"I am sorry, little halfling.",,1,MINSCJ
25686,Minsc,Why does this impish halfling jump around me like that? Is he dancing? Boo likes it when halflings dance around!,,1,MINSCJ
25741,Jaheira,"Have no fear for me, my friend. I am well capable of defending myself... and punishing those who commit such acts on others!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
25783,Jaheira,"It is not the magic that is evil, but the purpose behind it, and the purpose of many magic users is good... something I am sure even you have benefited from somehow.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
25807,Minsc,I think this is good for you. Boo also is sending his congratulations.,,1,MINSCJ
26277,Minsc,"I might join your hunt another time, but seabirds make Boo uncomfortable. It is best I spare them his wrath. Yes, best for all! But I must go now, little one.",,1,MINSCJ
26476,Jaheira,"N-no, that's quite all right. Do not make a fuss.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
26496,Jaheira,Heh...,,1,JAHEIRAJ
26497,Jaheira,Well...,,1,JAHEIRAJ
26498,Jaheira,What a... charming fellow. Completely insane of course. Out of his mind. Blind as a bat. No idea what he was saying.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
26503,Jaheira,Yes. Well.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
26504,Jaheira,Let's... let's get going shall we?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
26505,Jaheira,Um... I...,,1,JAHEIRAJ
26733,Jaheira,"The... the locket is lovely, by the way. Thank you.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
26961,Jaheira,Dermin? What are you doing back here? I am glad to see you; I had thought our friendship...,JAHEIRA8,1,JAHEIRAJ
26963,Jaheira,What are you talking about?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
26965,Jaheira,What? Such a thing has never been done!,,1,JAHEIRAJ
26967,Jaheira,What do you mean?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
26973,Jaheira,"Very well, Dermin. I will think on this.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
26975,Jaheira,"Well, that was decidedly unpleasant, and more than I wish to worry about.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
26979,Jaheira,Of... of course. It would be senseless. It does put a different light on things though. I will give this much thought indeed.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
26980,Jaheira,I am going to do exactly what I said I would do. I am going to think about this. All of this.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
26981,Jaheira,I have known him a long time. He was a mentor when I had none. I will think on this a long time. All of this.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
27134,Jaheira,What are you doing? Why are you here?,JAHEIRE7,1,JAHEIRAP
27142,Jaheira,you magnificent bastard! I would kill you for following me if I were not so glad to see you!,,1,JAHEIRAP
27181,Jaheira,Is it always about winning? Am I the simple treasure at the end of your trek? Would a golden chalice serve just as well? Or a sword?,,1,JAHEIRAP
27184,Jaheira,"Regardless, there are no Harpers here. None that act with sanction, anyway. They have made no effort to hide their motives from me; I was bait for you.",,1,JAHEIRAP
27190,Jaheira,"We may still be hunted. I must ask Dermin if I see him again. He told me to come here, so I need to know if his allegiance has changed or not.",,1,JAHEIRAP
27193,Jaheira,"I wanted to atone with the Harpers, but these are not they. I think revenge is more a factor here. The true Harpers have abandoned this garish place.",,1,JAHEIRAP
27215,Jaheira,"Passing by""? Athkatla? I see. Well, thank you for... thank you for following me, even if you are only ""passing by.""",,1,JAHEIRAP
27226,Jaheira,"Normally they would not allow it, but this place looks deserted by true Harpers since Galvarey's death. I'll wager it was too garish.",,1,JAHEIRAP
27232,Jaheira,"Notice the lack of spectral harpists? They were here at one time, and they would not leave their post unless it was no longer to be guarded.",,1,JAHEIRAP
27240,Jaheira,"Those we kill in self-defense may look like Harper allies, even if they are not. We have no choice, and I will not feel guilty over this tangled web anymore.",,1,JAHEIRAP
27245,Jaheira,"Let's get out of here, but take care: If their tactics are as simple as their motives, then you may have been allowed to pass. Our exit may be treacherous.",,1,JAHEIRAP
27248,Jaheira,I am glad too. We will talk later.,,1,JAHEIRAP
27252,Jaheira,I have nowhere left to go if not with you. You would leave me here with a likely ambush waiting outside?,,1,JAHEIRAP
27257,Jaheira,"Then... then this is goodbye. For all your words, they were right. Goodbye. I will not be seeing you again.",,1,JAHEIRAP
27405,Jaheira,Stop!,JAHEIRB2,1,JAHEIRAJ
27406,Jaheira,Do you see him? Ready yourself.,JAHEIRBX,1,JAHEIRAJ
27407,Jaheira,Dermin! I would speak at you!,,1,JAHEIRAJ
27409,Jaheira,"Shut up! I said I would speak AT you! This matter is finished! I will not acknowledge this again! If you press it, I will be forced to deal with you!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
27411,Jaheira,"Yes, actually, and you well know it! Galvarey was no more a Harper than a treant. His actions betrayed him, and all those that followed him!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
27412,Jaheira,"The garish Hold, his political agenda-he was merely using the weight of the Harper name to promote himself. Tell me: What did he offer you?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
27414,Jaheira,"Then I am better for it. Call me traitor, but I have followed the spirit of the Harpers. You are the traitor, and if the events were known, others would see!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
27416,Jaheira,"Of course not. Despite the ambushes, you will still be able to claim the moral high ground for your actions. What happened to you, Dermin? I do not know you.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
27418,Jaheira,At the cost of the innocents. That is always the way.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
27420,Jaheira,It certainly disrupted you. The innocents also include Harpers that have died thinking they were fighting for the right cause. Galvarey's cause. Your cause.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
27422,Jaheira,"As was yours, though I suspect you have been gone for years.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
27424,Jaheira,"Save it, Dermin. I have no more guilt about facing you or any other sent on this fool's crusade. You are the betrayers, not I. I know this in my heart.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
27426,Jaheira,"I did not wish to do this. I did not. We are in the right, but why does it still hurt?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
27430,Jaheira,"Heh, you and your jokes make me smile far too often, even when I do not want to. People will think I am getting soft.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
27433,Jaheira,"Haha! Shush you! I'm supposed to be feeling bad about this whole thing. Oh, let's just get moving.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
27434,Jaheira,*snicker*,,1,JAHEIRAJ
27435,Jaheira,"I've sat through all of your little plots and plans. The least you can do is toss me a bone now and then. Yeesh, take their thunder for one conversation and they gets all touchy.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
27436,Jaheira,Let's get out of here. We've still got things to do.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
27437,Jaheira,"Yes, yes, you do what you can, not always what you want. The Big Little Book of Alaundo, right? Insightful.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
27438,Jaheira,"I am sorry, I shouldn't be taking my anger out on you. Let's just get moving. I'll be all right in a while.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
27439,Jaheira,"Heh, a wise move. I will not have this situation made trite. I may be in a foul mood for a while, you understand? Yes, I think you do. Thank you.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
27689,Minsc,Boo is no pet... he is a fine companion for Minsc. But he seems to like you anyway.,,1,MINSCJ
27863,Jaheira,"Are you trying to tell me, bard, that you do not remember us? You were working for that evil sorceress, Silke, when we ran into you.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
27865,Jaheira,"Well, you didn't have many thoughts in your head then, and it is obvious you do not have many now.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
28450,Jaheira,"Perhaps you should go and soak your head within a bucket, guard, before you attempt to address me again.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
29580,Minsc,Perhaps people just need a swift kick in the punctuals!,,1,MINSCJ
29582,Minsc,"No, I seldom have time for reading. Too much work to be done!",,1,MINSCJ
29651,Jaheira,"Obviously, if I did have a problem, you would be the very last person I would be speaking to, you selfish and close-minded fool.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
29662,Minsc,"Why? In beloved Rashemen, if things don't work, we encourage them with a loving backhand of productivity!",,1,MINSCJ
29838,Minsc,"A thinking game! Minsc knows the answer then! Evil ends in death, because I put my foot in its backside!",,1,MINSCJ
29839,Minsc,Oops. I apologize.,,1,MINSCJ
29854,Minsc,This is a foolish question! Who travels with you? Minsc does! What else matters?,,1,MINSCJ
29857,Minsc,"Oops. I apologize. Next time, I let Boo answer.",,1,MINSCJ
30033,Jaheira,You Amnian are too closed-minded about the demihuman kin that live amongst you in peace... they are not so different from you as you seem to think.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
30059,Jaheira,"You certainly are not! And perhaps you should think, sir, before you speak such insults so candidly.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
30107,Minsc,"You cannot have Boo, little girl! But you may pet him and make pretty cooing noises if you wishes.",,1,MINSCJ
33134,Minsc,Boo is not food. Maybe I should throw you to the cute little meat-eaters and see how you like it?,,1,MINSCJ
33335,Jaheira,"Too... weak... I feel the curse within... Damn you, Ployer! I'll be cured yet...",JAHEIRD1,1,JAHEIRAJ
33663,Jaheira,"Her cause seems just, and she is druid kin of a sort. Let us do our best to aid.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
34526,Jaheira,"I will find my own way, and... *cough*... and damned if I won't live to see you die on this path you've chosen. Ah, I will waste no more breath on you!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
34528,Jaheira,You wish me gone! I- *cough* I shall seek help on my own. A word before I go: Beware your friends. No doubt they will eventually treat you as you treat them.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
34529,Jaheira,"He was irredeemable when he was on trial. He lives because he ""donated"" to the state. I will make good use of our next meeting, but not just because of his attack.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
37425,IDRYAD1,My queen! you has saved us. Can our trees be saved? Has Irenicus doomed us?,,1,IDRYAD1
37428,IDRYAD1,"Thank you, my queen.",,1,IDRYAD1
37848,Rielev,I thank thee. Go and leave me to oblivion at last. Sweet sleep...,RIELEV06,1,RIELEV
37849,Rielev,You are heartless. I again feel hate.,,1,RIELEV
37850,Imoen,He's... he's dead now? This pathetic creature...,IMOENJ50,1,IMOENJ
37851,Imoen,"I can't look away. I have seen death in our scuffles before, but here I did nothing but watch his life end...",,1,IMOENJ
37852,Imoen,I can't look away.,,1,IMOENJ
37856,Imoen,"Death is... pretty. Why would I think that? Oh, I've got to get out of this place.",,1,IMOENJ
37857,Imoen,This poor creature wishes to die? Right here? We should...,IMOENJ51,1,IMOENJ
37858,Imoen,We should help... we should... we should see what happens now!,,1,IMOENJ
38474,Imoen,"Oh, all right, but then we have to get going. It isn't safe here.",,1,IMOEN10
38475,Imoen,"We lived at Candlekeep. It was the safest place, what with you having that Bhaal blood. You were with Gorion. I guess I came along later.",,1,IMOEN10
38480,Imoen,"I think they let us stay because Gorion had powerful friends. I wish he had said where I was before that, but he thought it wasn't important, so I didn't worry too much.",,1,IMOEN10
38485,Imoen,"Gorion was like a father, but I preferred old Winthrop. He was the innkeep, and he taught me about keeping out of sight and such.",,1,IMOEN10
38486,Imoen,"We left when Sarevok killed Gorion. I was sorry I couldn't help, but we got him in the end. Remember that? That Sarevok turned out to be a child of Bhaal, like you?",,1,IMOEN10
38487,Imoen,"Anyway, now we're stuck in this place after getting captured by some creep that has been torturing us! Now, can we please go?",,1,IMOEN10
38536,Jaheira,"Imoen! Quickly, child, bring you to me. I would have words with them if they is able.",,1,JAHEIRA
38537,Imoen,I can help you too. Should I not try? I hate to see you cooped up like that.,,1,IMOENJ
38538,Jaheira,"Of course, but if you is here as well, I should speak with them.",,1,JAHEIRA
38539,Imoen,"Minsc, that is horrible! I am so sorry for you.",,1,IMOENJ
38542,Minsc,"I won't cry for the dead! I won't! Okay, maybe a little, but I will staunch the flow of tears with righteous fury! Lullaby and goodnight, evil! Minsc will make you pay!",,1,MINSCA
38543,Imoen,"Eww, I... really don't want to think about that too much.",,1,IMOENJ
38544,Imoen,I... I know this room. I've been in here... we both have. He... There are things in these tanks. They used to be people...,IMOENJ52,1,IMOENJ
38559,Imoen,"What kind of monster is this guy? Captures us easy as pie, kills whoever he wants... that could have been us in those glass things.",,1,IMOENJ
38563,Imoen,"I don't know about that, Minsc, but he sure is a cute little fuzzy wuzzy. Aren't you, Boo?",,1,IMOENJ
38584,Imoen,"We don't even know where we are, and my head is still doing funny things... He said something... something about potential.",,1,IMOENJ
38599,Imoen,"Are we? Horrible, horrible things surround us, and my head still hurts like crazy. I want to know what he did to me. I remember... something about potential.",,1,IMOENJ
38602,Imoen,He said it about you too: something about power that can be unleashed. I don't care; I just have to get out. Can we leave this room? It bothers me.,,1,IMOENJ
38603,Imoen,I want to know what he did to me too. My head still hurts really bad. He said... said something about potential... about you too.,,1,IMOENJ
38606,Imoen,"Wow, a golem. Powerful magic stuff. Odd that it's not hostile. I suppose its maker didn't expect us to escape, so it never got orders for restraining us.",,1,IMOENJ
38611,Imoen,"They only do exactly what they are directed to; they don't really think. If it hasn't been told to keep quiet, we might get some information out of it.",,1,IMOENJ
38612,Imoen,What...? What is this place? It's-it's beautiful! Oh... there is simply no way that this space belongs to the same person that owns those horrible glass containers.,IMOENJ53,1,IMOENJ
38619,Imoen,"No, it can't be. Not the person I know. This... this bed, that table... I know of them. He would... he would speak of them while... while he...",,1,IMOENJ
38620,Imoen,"It's for a lost love, kept in perfect condition. She... she despises him. This is his monument to her. He spoke of all of this, but... but his voice was cold...",,1,IMOENJ
38621,Imoen,"No emotion at all, not even remembered. He spoke of these things even while he cut... he cut... and the spells that wove through my brain... cold, ugly things!",,1,IMOENJ
38624,Imoen,"It still hurts... his sick fingers are still in my head, doing whatever it was he started. I see blood... and death... behind my eyes... Irenicus...",,1,IMOENJ
38625,Imoen,"This room: If he could care for anything, he would care for this room. Above the lives of all of us. It makes me sick. I feel... I feel... so much hate.",,1,IMOENJ
38626,Imoen,"I would burn this place, but it is nothing. Even as it means so much, it is nothing. Let's do what we must and get out of this place; it is making me sick.",,1,IMOENJ
38627,Imoen,"We are nothing; that's why the golems don't care. Why bother worrying about gnats? Besides, he doesn't need to catch us. I can tell. I can feel it.",,1,IMOENJ
38628,Imoen,"Duergar, I think. Kind of evil, I guess, so I'm not surprised they would be working for our captor.",,1,IMOENJ
38631,Imoen,"For the knives, probably. The knives... he has a lot of them... I'm going to have a couple of scars from this... looks like you will too.",,1,IMOENJ
38632,Imoen,I doubt he cares for anything more than the quality of knives they make. He has a lot of them... I'm going to have scars from this... looks like you will too.,,1,IMOENJ
38633,Imoen,Jaheira... I wanna say how sorry I am about Khalid. I... I know this is hard...,IMOENJ54,1,IMOENJ
38634,Jaheira,"No! You do not know. This is not the time for this conversation, child.",JAHEIRE1,1,JAHEIRAJ
38635,Imoen,"Stop calling me ""child."" I'm as old as you, and besides, I can tell you that Khalid did not suffer.",,1,IMOENJ
38636,Jaheira,"What are you babbling about, Imoen? I am not in the mood.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
38637,Imoen,I'm not babbling! I saw him do this! Khalid was dead when our captor started... doing those things to him!,,1,IMOENJ
38638,Jaheira,You saw this? You watched as it was done?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
38639,Imoen,He... he showed me. He cut and... and showed me. He forced my eyes open and made me look as he...,,1,IMOENJ
38640,Jaheira,"Stop, I don't want to hear this.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
38641,Imoen,"He said I should see, so I would understand, but I don't know what he wanted! He would cut and say ""Do you see?"" Cut and say ""Do you see?""",,1,IMOENJ
38642,Jaheira,"Be quiet, child! No more!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
38643,Imoen,"I am not a child! I'm as old as you, and I've... I've seen. I can see...",,1,IMOENJ
38644,Jaheira,"You've seen some horrible things best forgotten. We all have, in our day. This will pass when we... avenge the fallen and... bury this son of a bitch.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
38645,Imoen,"I see now... in my head... cut, ""yes, I see...""",,1,IMOENJ
38646,Jaheira,Imoen! Enough! Let's go!,,1,JAHEIRAJ
38647,Imoen,So beautiful! I used to dream of dryads and their beautiful trees.,IMOENJ55,1,IMOENJ
38648,IDRYAD1,"You are welcome among us, girl. Youthful exuberance is music that we have not heard in such a long time.",,1,IDRYAD1
38649,Imoen,"I used to dream... but he doesn't. Your charms don't work on him anymore, do they?",,1,IMOENJ
38650,IDRYAD1,"How do you know of this? He has touched you as us, hasn't he? Irenicus searches for something he cannot find, and he looks within those that have no more idea than he.",,1,IDRYAD1
38651,Imoen,Irenicus...,,1,IMOENJ
38652,IDRYAD1,A name that is synonymous with death and ugliness.,,1,IDRYAD1
38653,Imoen,"No, death sounds different. He showed me... I spit on his name. I spit on this place.",,1,IMOENJ
38654,IDRYAD1,"Live as you can where you must, young woman. You will not survive if you give in. We have learned this.",,1,IDRYAD1
38655,Imoen,"I have learned... something different. So beautiful you are. I almost can't see you. I just want to go home. Oh, when can we go home?",,1,IMOENJ
38659,IDRYAD2,"We are supposed to instill emotion, but he is barren inside. I am not sure what he expects.",,1,IDRYAD2
38660,IDRYAD2,"We are supposed to instill emotion, but he is barren inside. I am not sure what he expects.",,1,IDRYAD2
38661,Imoen,I've gotta hand it to you... you sure have some kind of courage to sleep in this place. I would've run screaming a dozen times over if you weren't here.,IMOENJ56,1,IMOENJ
38665,Imoen,"I guess I should be used to sleeping with both eyes open. I don't deal with this well. We're alike because of Gorion, but I prefer being in the background.",,1,IMOENJ
38668,Minsc,This is silly! Buttons are not how one escapes dungeons! I would smash the button and rain beatings liberally down on the wizard for playing such a trick!,,1,MINSCJ
38671,Imoen,"He was a great mage, and supposedly a great adventurer. It's funny; we lived with him for years, and Jaheira seems to know more about him.",,1,IMOENJ
38672,Imoen,"I guess he was a big friend of the Harpers. Even got a visit from Khelben ""Blackstaff"" once. Real powerful mage. Talked to Gorion like an equal.",,1,IMOENJ
38674,Imoen,"I wish we could go back to those days, before all this fuss and bother. Before I learned... Well, we've seen so much. Candlekeep seems so small now.",,1,IMOENJ
38675,Jaheira,"We have done nothing to you. I see that you are an elf... We are prisoners here, as are you. Perhaps if we could-",,1,JAHEIRAJ
38676,Jaheira,"Nonsense, he was secretive with everyone. We just had... mutual acquaintances.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
38686,Imoen,"Seems like we're not important enough to worry about. I'm just not up to this like you. We're alike because of Gorion, but I prefer being in the background.",,1,IMOENJ
38690,Imoen,"Does it? Then I feel better. I figured I didn't deal with this as well as you. We're alike because of Gorion, but I prefer being in the background.",,1,IMOENJ
38692,Jaheira,"So... I see we have a name for our captor at last. Irenicus, is it? Tell me, dryads, why this Irenicus would go to such lengths to keep you three here?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
38696,Minsc,"Irenicus? There is a special place in my bootprint for him, and I shall fill it in the name of Dynaheir! Such evil to keep forest spirits locked away!",,1,MINSCJ
38697,Imoen,"Well, when people are in danger, sure. Winthrop taught me how to get out of trouble, but Gorion always said there are times when it's worth getting into it.",,1,IMOENJ
38699,Jaheira,Surely you won't refuse them the chance to return to their forest? It takes no effort from us and would be a kindness to them. Think it over.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
38703,Imoen,"Yeah, you're right. I don't want to spend a second more in this place than I have to. My head still hurts, and I keep seeing things in corners and such.",,1,IMOENJ
38704,Imoen,"We won't be able to just walk away, you know. The guy that captured us... he knows about you. He said something about potential, something about great power.",,1,IMOENJ
38705,Imoen,"Funny, that. I was sorry to go, but I couldn't let you wander off on your own, now could I? After Gorion d... died, you needed all the help you could get.",,1,IMOENJ
38706,Imoen,"Not that I'm much help right now. My head still aches, and I keep seeing things. Too much death around here, everywhere. It's in everything, even me.",,1,IMOENJ
38707,Imoen,"We still had friends there. They were proud, even if they didn't show it. Winthrop said so. He always thought Gorion was too stuffy. I don't know though.",,1,IMOENJ
38708,Imoen,"Ooh, my head still hurts, and I keep thinking I see... things in the corners. Too much death here for my liking. It's in everything, even us.",,1,IMOENJ
38720,Jaheira,"It is monstrous that one would do such a thing to a servant, to lock him away in an eternity of pain. It offends nature.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
38723,Minsc,"I would hate being forgotten in a bottle. It might depend somewhat on the type of bottle, but overall I expect the effect would be similar. It is not right.",,1,MINSCJ
38726,Jaheira,"Nature does not intend her creations to live past their allotted time. Certainly not this forgotten servant, tormented and then left for dead, but not dead.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
38729,Jaheira,"I wonder how this master came to live such a life that he abandons much of it? The fault of ill-considered magic, no doubt. We shall see when we find him.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
38734,Imoen,What a tortured creature that clone thing was. She was a copy? A copy of another person?,IMOENJ57,1,IMOENJ
38735,Imoen,I wonder why Irenicus made her? I doubt he took pleasure in her company; he's beyond that. He's fascinated with death. He showed me... over and over...,,1,IMOENJ
38742,Jaheira,"you will do as they decides is best. While kind enough to give the beggar a coin, there is no need for them to give away everything they owns.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
38761,Jaheira,"For shame, that you could speak to a child so. Have you no compassion for the helpless?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
38764,Minsc,"We must help this child! I will find who took his mother and teach them a thing or three about decency, respect, and keeping their hands off of people's parents!",,1,MINSCJ
38773,Jaheira,"Take care. I have heard of these Cowled Wizards. Spellcasters of the highest order, the only magic-users allowed here in Amn, I believe.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
38774,Minsc,Owl wizards?,,1,MINSCJ
38779,Minsc,"It is no risk! Not so long as we have swords and braveness to the brim of the tall glass of goodness! Right, Boo?",,1,MINSCJ
38787,Imoen,"Oh... this reminds me so much of Candlekeep. Dusty old tomes all over, bookcases nearly spilling. It's... like we never left...",IMOENJ58,1,IMOENJ
38788,Imoen,"But we did, didn't we? I just want to go home again. It doesn't matter where it is, just so long as I can call it home.",,1,IMOENJ
38862,Jaheira,"Greetings to you, good sir. I trust all is well?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
38864,Jaheira,"I am not here in an official capacity, suspicious one. There is no need to worry.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
38877,Jaheira,"The gnome is dead. How he was able to perform these great feats of illusion will have to remain a mystery, it seems.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
38911,Minsc,I will protect my witch! EVIL SHALL SUFFER AT THE HANDS OF MINSC AND HIS WITCH! WOE TO THOSE WHO WOULD BRING DANGER TO AERIE!,,1,MINSCJ
38920,Jaheira,"That was unbecoming of you, to be so forceful with one of such a lesser station. But I suppose you shall do as you wish regardless.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
38936,Minsc,We must aid him! Evil stands before me and demands a quick kick in the posterior!,,1,MINSCJ
38941,Jaheira,"It sounds like there is a trade of flesh going on, but questioning this man will get us nowhere. Perhaps a more thorough inquiry is called for.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
38943,Minsc,"I will not stand and watch men carting slaves! THEY SHALL FEEL MY BLADE AND BOOT AND BACKHAND AS WELL! GO FOR THE EYES, BOO, GO FOR THE EYES!",,1,MINSCJ
38944,Jaheira,"I doubt this man is a prisoner. More likely a slave, prohibitions notwithstanding. A revolting practice wherever it is carried out.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
38960,Minsc,"Hmmm... the sphere is awfully big for only 500 gold pieces. It might be a good bargain. What say you, Boo?",,1,MINSCJ
39178,Jaheira,"There is nothing wrong with a noble task duly undertaken. And perhaps it will be enjoyable to see you in a greener setting, dwarf.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
39181,Jaheira,I hope you intend to go to this village soon. A visit to greener lands would be welcome after our trek through this crowded city.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
39182,Minsc,"We shall go and save the village for the boy! I will crush the evil! All of the evil! Even the small, rodent-sized evil... although that is more Boo's job.",,1,MINSCJ
39270,Minsc,They throw this man into a pit with a wild beast? This is a crime against man AND nature! They will surely feel my wrath for this travesty!,,1,MINSCJ
39282,Jaheira,"You may wish to reconsider your refusal. This may be a way to overcome the slavers here for good. It is the honorable path, if you are interested.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
39288,Minsc,"We are going to free this warrior and his people? This is a task of great honor! We shall be great heroes for this, heroes doing heroic things for all to see!",,1,MINSCJ

39353,Minsc,"This man is a great evil if he does such things! The shining blades of goodness must be raised against him! Justice demands a painful, pointy thrashing!",,1,MINSCJ
39362,Jaheira,"Do not overly concern yourself with the pursuit of precious metals alone, Korgan. There are other matters that we must consider here.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
39364,Jaheira,"Ah, a chance to strike at the heart of slavery here in Athkatla. Think of it; you could make a difference, if you wish. At least for a while.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
39365,Minsc,"More children kept as slaves! Boo is outraged by the evil that leaps about this city like a hot-footed weasel! We must save the children, we must!",,1,MINSCJ
39372,Jaheira,"A thoroughly despicable man... and an equally despicable place. This is the sort of thing that comes naturally with civilization, it seems.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
39398,Jaheira,"No, he is not. He has no interest in anything you might have to sell, woman.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
39402,Jaheira,"Druids would not attack a town without cause. It would be a very extreme reaction, and is definitely something we should investigate.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
39403,Minsc,"It cannot be! I would sooner tear out my eyes than strike down innocent animals! Well, perhaps only one eye... but do not think me any less incensed!",,1,MINSCJ
39410,Minsc,"You will not! I will fight to save each and every creature, dwarf! The forest feeds and nurtures, and I will not hesitate to put a birch up your backside!",,1,MINSCJ
39411,Minsc,"Why? I have never heard such head-biting villainy, except perhaps in the larger cities, but what passes for entertainment these days is not for me to decide.",,1,MINSCJ
39412,Minsc,"Your strange jest is wearing thin, dwarf. I suggest you sate yourself with chicken in the proper place and time, and leave the woodland creatures as they were.",,1,MINSCJ
39413,Jaheira,"You will not, Korgan. There is a disturbance in nature that we are to restore... I will not have you swinging about, heedless of the consequences.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
39414,Jaheira,"You may wish to reconsider, Korgan. Doves can carry several diseases, and I wouldn't wish you vomiting and cramps simply for being an ignorant lout.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
39415,Jaheira,"You're welcome to try, but you are not the only one trained in martial skill. Remember that in the forest, you are in my domain and at an extreme disadvantage.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
39419,Minsc,"You insult you, and you insult Minsc! There will be liberal butt-kicking now!",,1,MINSCJ
39422,Jaheira,"I thought such childish antics to be above you. But if it makes you feel better, I suppose I cannot stop you.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
39424,Jaheira,I cannot believe you would partake in such cruelty. I refuse to watch this.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
39425,Minsc,You pay for dogs to fight in this filthy place? You cannot imagine my anger! I shall find properly heroic companions elsewhere if you continue such outrages!,,1,MINSCJ

42219,Jaheira,Shut up! No more words! Words are nothing!,,1,JAHEIRAJ
42221,Jaheira,Stranger! Nobody! I will not hear your words! Leave me!,,1,JAHEIRAJ
42222,Minsc,"A brave man has fallen here, but that is no cause to hurl insults at the living. Here, Boo shall comfort you.",,1,MINSCJ
42223,Jaheira,"No words! No more words! Save your speeches, save your proverbs! The only voice I wish to hear is... is dead! No more! No...",,1,JAHEIRAJ
42224,Jaheira,Imbecile! Affront to nature! What do you and your rodent know? What can you know?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
42225,Jaheira,No...,,1,JAHEIRAJ

42231,Jaheira,"It is my wont to do this, and I shall see that it is done properly. If you would assist, more the better. If not, be prepared to stand aside.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
44075,Minsc,Pirate Lord? Such a name does not conjure images of righteous behavior. Stand still a moment and let Boo have a look at you.,,1,MINSCJ
44077,Minsc,Boo will soon have you figured out. You certainly seem friendlier than I would think a Pirate Lord would be. And where is your peg?,,1,MINSCJ
44079,Minsc,"Your peg. A proper pirate has a peg, whether a leg, arm or... uh... some other expendable extremity. And a parrot.",,1,MINSCJ
44081,Minsc,"Certainly! As I have my Boo, so too must you have your parrot. Boo likes parrots. They could wrassel.",,1,MINSCJ
44176,Minsc,"Little Imoen, it is Minsc. See, here's Boo... Boo, stop that. It's Imoen. Sure she looks a bit... stressed, but it's still her.",,1,MINSCJ
44177,Minsc,I don't know what's wrong. Boo is all jittery. Something is different about Imoen.,,1,MINSCJ
44178,Jaheira,"She seems distant. Those are not Imoen's eyes. Not the one we knew, anyway.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
47077,Jaheira,"An excellent warning, if vague. I shall think on your words, though I doubt I shall alter my course. What will come will come.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
47088,Minsc,"Oooh! This is most goodness of news, is it not, Boo?",,1,MINSCJ
47174,Minsc,"Boo needs to know, did you want us to remain with the group?",MINSC90,1,MINSCP
47215,Imoen,"Something strange up here. Be careful, this place has all manner of dangerous devices in it. I don't know what they do, but I know we would be safer if we shut them off.",,1,IMOENJ
47217,Imoen,"We should look in that room to the west first, west and just a bit north. I think I saw some weapons in there. It's a room off the corner of this one.",,1,IMOEN10
47220,Imoen,"Do you smell that? Smells like lightning, but indoors? That can't be right. I think I remember. Look to the right... the machine making the storm...",,1,IMOENJ
48284,Jaheira,Shall we travel as before?,,1,JAHEIRAP
48295,Jaheira,Then I will go to the Harper Hold in Athkatla. Much must be done to make people respect the reputation of the Harpers again. I will be there if you seek me.,,1,JAHEIRAP
48296,Jaheira,"Then I take my leave. I do not like the way you have been leaning lately, and no doubt we would have eventually fought. I bid you farewell.",,1,JAHEIRAP
48466,Jaheira,"Have you no sense of charity, dwarf? What is the sense of freeing such children only to subject them to starvation and destitution, then?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48475,Jaheira,"Really, couldn't you have spared a little gold for the child? You may have rescued them only to subject them to starvation and worse.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48480,Jaheira,"And one wonders how long you have been able to hide your arrogance and disregard behind a semblance of honor, Anomen. Helm would disapprove, I think.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48481,Jaheira,"I do not fear you, knight! Any moment you wish to meet on the field of battle, I will be there!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48485,Jaheira,"It comes as no surprise to me that an immoral dwarf such as you has a heart of stone, Korgan. I simply expect better from you.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48491,Jaheira,"That you did, but there is a responsibility that comes with such actions as well. You might decide to ponder that at some point in the future.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48504,Minsc,"What? They have no shame in trading lives of others? Evil, meet my trusty sword! Sword: MEET EVIL!",,1,MINSCJ
48512,Jaheira,"How sad, to have been kept prisoner in such a state. And by what? The presence in the sword? It does not make sense.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48515,Jaheira,"A puzzle, obviously. We must find the four things spoken of to unlock whatever mystery is hidden here. Who would hide something in such a fashion, I wonder?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48525,Minsc,Ooh! To take swords against monsters of great evil! Already I feel Boo wriggling in excited anticipation!,,1,MINSCJ
48526,Minsc,"Of course it is Boo. Boo is always happy when opportunities for heroism come! We shall crush these ogres, and rangers and hamsters everywhere shall rejoice!",,1,MINSCJ
48530,Jaheira,I think it would be an excellent idea to get outside of the city and administer justice on such evil creatures. Tyranny is best matched with equal force.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
48534,Jaheira,"I've fought many an ogre in the past, dwarf, and many other powerful evil creatures aside from such. You should be wary that I do not add you to the list.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48551,Jaheira,"Ah, Gorion once said that he and some Harpers dealt a humiliating blow to a dragon in the Stormhorn Mountains. I was not aware this was the same one.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48559,Minsc,I... would strike for goodness... but this dragon is so... so... It would not be cowardice to come back another day with bigger swords!,,1,MINSCJ
48573,Jaheira,"I am sure you have your reasons, but be not quick to turn down an offer of sanctuary. I am not eager to battle paladins without need.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48585,Minsc,we must find this fiend who steals children and disguises knights as monsters and apply a butt-kicking for goodness! All must be avenged!,,1,MINSCJ
48592,Jaheira,"Indeed. They seek your agreement before telling you what they wish you to do. The Cowled Wizards are not to be trusted, as you well know.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48599,Jaheira,"While surely all murderers must be brought to task, I wonder what manner of justice the Cowled Wizards would apply. It is something to consider.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48615,Minsc,This changes everything! A fellow ranger plunged into peril by evil wizards! Even Boo cringes at what we have been sent to do! this cannot be!,,1,MINSCJ
48618,Minsc,A fellow brother of the woods! Is this the man the wizards have sent us to kill? tell me it is not so!,,1,MINSCJ
48623,Minsc,"You... you would not lead Boo and me astray! We do good things; we are heroes! This man lies, I say, and I shall fight with you!",,1,MINSCJ
48624,Minsc,"No! I will not allow you to kill a fellow brother of the woods! You have become evil, and I have allowed it to happen! No longer will I stand by!",,1,MINSCJ
48630,Jaheira,"We will have to be careful with the Cowled Wizards now at our heels. But it is a righteous cause, and another companion to stand at our side is always welcome.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48631,Minsc,"Be welcome, brother of the woods! Together, you and Boo and I shall stride forward to crush all evil in our wake! Woe betide evil!",,1,MINSCJ
48645,Jaheira,"And well you should be. This is coward's work, despicable to the core.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48668,Jaheira,"You are mistaken. I do not bear that name, and I will not. The greater balance bids me here.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48678,Jaheira,"You are lucky we did not allow the creatures to complete what they started. You are a fool, merchant, and should think with your head instead of your purse.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48693,Jaheira,I think I should like to walk through this place when we no longer need anything from the devil we know.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
48713,Minsc,"Me? No, Boo would never allow such a thing! My sword is meant only for being firmly planted in the heart of evil!",,1,MINSCJ
48762,Jaheira,"I... I am not always frowning, I... oh, go away, child. Why are the children of this city so annoying?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48783,Minsc,"WHERE? Where is there a rat? Oh, you have frightened Boo with your screeching. Calm yourself, Boo. See? We are leaving the loud woman.",,1,MINSCJ
48814,Jaheira,Hmm... wait one moment... do I know you?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
48815,Jaheira,"I see. A Zhentish agent, if I recall, but one of no consequence. Pay him no heed.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48852,Minsc,"*sniff* Ahh, even Boo cringes from such a foul odor. Surely this instrument will never make beautiful music again.",,1,MINSCJ
48889,Jaheira,"Ah, yes. The infamous capacity for drow compassion is revealed once again. Ignore her, and let us get this task over with quickly.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48901,Jaheira,"Ah, Berinvar is not a Harper, but I certainly am. Will you treat my guests as friends and answer? I assume the guardians are spectral harpists?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48902,Minsc,"They... they attack this funny man? Why? This evil must be stopped with generous doses of sword-swinging! Come, Boo, we go for the eyes!",,1,MINSCJ
48907,Jaheira,He and the others seem preoccupied with the trinkets around their necks. I find it odd I have not heard of this before now. Harpers do not often wear symbols to make themselves *more* noticeable.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
48924,Jaheira,This person makes me ill. I suggest we move on before I ignore the greater balance and return him to the dust.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
48926,Jaheira,No doubt you have plied your trade on good folk as well in the past. Your balance will come in the end. Nothing goes unpunished.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
48946,Minsc,"Heroes of goodness need no warning! Where we tread, evil trembles in our wake!",,1,MINSCJ
48951,Jaheira,"The confines of the city do much to chisel at the sanity of its inhabitants, but I wonder if there is some other force at work. We had best be wary.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48959,Minsc,"I would rather have given a sword. Give a man a fish and he eats for a day, but teach a man to fight and he can chow down on the meaty marrow of evil!",,1,MINSCJ
48960,Jaheira,"I'm not sure the lieutenant should go alone. We have evidence of the culprit, but we know nothing of his ability. There may be danger we are not aware of.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48967,Jaheira,"His work? What does he speak of? Quickly, we must stop him before he escapes!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48968,Minsc,"Wha-aat? This is the evil man who steals skins? He must be stopped! He must be stopped, or all who have skins will sleep in fear!",,1,MINSCJ
48969,Minsc,"We shall answer your attack, though even Boo sees no sense in it!",,1,MINSCJ
48976,Jaheira,"This... this place smells heavily of death, and the evidence of it is all around us. Step carefully, for I believe we enter the workshop sanctum of a madman.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
48982,Jaheira,"I have little doubt, that we will also find Lieutenant Aegisfield somewhere herein... Hopefully, the man is still alive.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49023,Minsc,"I understand none of this, but if the one who killed Dynaheir is beyond, Boo and Minsc will make short work of you!",,1,MINSCJ
49030,Jaheira,"You are mistaken, but I care not! Khalid will be avenged whether you stand aside willingly or not!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49035,Imoen,Get out of my way! I don't want to fight any of you; I just want to leave!,,1,IMOENJ
49206,Jaheira,"I should think not! Child, surely you are better than this? Are you certain of this choice?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49208,Jaheira,"That was unnecessarily harsh. I can see that we shall be at odds more often than not, drow.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49248,Jaheira,Such a lack of compassion is unseemly for a knight. Would you have others judge you as quickly?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
49263,Jaheira,"One should not turn away an offered hand so quickly, but I would be wary of its secretive origin. Perhaps we can find Imoen on our own.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49269,Minsc,"We don't need money to find Imoen! We are heroes! We will crush wizard after wizard to find her! Hmm, we should start soon if we hope to be done by dinner...",,1,MINSCJ
49282,Jaheira,Shadow Thieves? Perhaps we shall finally get answers as to their interest in us.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
49295,Jaheira,"My own Harpers have used us. I should have suspected... the gaudy necklaces, the invitation. Ah well. If Xzar was doing as she said, he deserved his fate.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49320,Minsc,I remember you! And so does Boo! A craven wizard who travels with his untrustworthy halfling!,,1,MINSCJ
49322,Jaheira,"I was wondering when you would turn up, Zhent. I had suspected our parting would not be permanent when last we met, and it appears my suspicions were correct.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49339,Jaheira,"Be wary, the Harpers will not brook interference lightly, and this Zhent likely holds only the worst of intentions in his heart.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49347,Jaheira,"Well, if you wish to investigate what has happened to the spy, that is up to you. I suggest caution and perhaps some common sense.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49348,Jaheira,"If the Harpers will even speak to us, which I doubt, they certainly will not reveal what they did with the halfling. Best not to ask about him directly.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49384,Jaheira,"It is good that this is the final of these tasks set for us. I've no taste for bounty hunting, but let us find this thief and have the deed done with quickly.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49404,Jaheira,"Yes, this is an odd structure for the Harpers to erect. I have never heard of an opulent base such as this. Secrecy has always been the watchword before.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49410,Jaheira,"I am a Harper, Meronia. May I be allowed to speak to these guardians? I assume they are spectral harpists. Perhaps they could satisfy my... curiosity.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49415,Minsc,"Oh, I never step on toes... except by accident, maybe. If Boo had me step on toes for real, toes would gloriously be flying everywhere in the wake of my sword!",,1,MINSCJ
49419,Jaheira,"Yes... I've noticed the amulets you wear. I've heard of the Harper pins, but nothing of these. Is this a local custom?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49466,Yoshimo,"There you are, I see. Why do you continue? You are dead inside already. Irenicus has seen to it. I am left to finish your physical shell.",YOSHIM66,1,YOSHIMOX
49471,Yoshimo,Bring your wrath to bear if you are so sure. I doubt you will outlive the tenday regardless! I will not bother with excuses; I cannot fight his spells.,YOSHIM67,1,YOSHIMOX
49473,Yoshimo,"No redemptions, no second chances! Let us get this over with! I stride into the hell that Irenicus promised! Ilmater take my heart, I have no choice!",YOSHIM68,1,YOSHIMOX
49474,Minsc,"You shall be called what you are! You are an enemy of fair, departed Dynaheir and therefore an enemy of mine! You shall be destroyed for the good of all!",,1,MINSCJ
49479,Minsc,"You will not speak of sweet Dynaheir in this fashion! Terrible hamster justice will be wreaked upon you! GO FOR THE EYES, BOO, GO-",,1,MINSCJ
49481,Minsc,"I... no. No, our cause must not be disrupted. Righteous fury will wait for now, but one day the wizard shall pay for his words with blood! So swears Minsc!",,1,MINSCJ
49483,Yoshimo,I did not spend so much time in you's company just to have them killed. That could have been done a dozen times over.,,1,YOSHIMOX
49489,Jaheira,"Your memory is selective, Red Wizard. Why do you now work with Shadow Thieves, and what is your connection to our capture by Irenicus? Khalid is dead, and I will have an answer!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49506,Minsc,"My anger can only barely be contained! Speak to us as if we are anything but heroes, wizard, and you shall be receiving the rented-mule beating you deserve!",,1,MINSCJ
49510,Minsc,"Dynaheir's enemy comes with us? Please, say it will not be so! And if it is so, let it be brief! Boo shakes with such anger I cannot blame him!",,1,MINSCJ
49540,Jaheira,"How about conscience, dwarf? Or morality? Perhaps you knows what is best.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49552,Jaheira,"Do not make us laugh, thief master. We have heard of your guild war. You would not approach outsiders if your own house were strong and solid, hm?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49553,Jaheira,You would abandon Imoen here? I would rather leave myself than have you cast her away in this place. It is not right.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
49554,Minsc,We do the bidding of thieves now? Ehhh... this churns my belly like a hamster running endlessly within a wheel. This can't be a good sign.,,1,MINSCJ
49556,Minsc,"Rashemen is my home, but I haven't seen it for many moons. I am on my dajemma. I... failed my last witch... but nothing will happen to Aerie! Nothing!",,1,MINSCJ
49557,Minsc,"No, it will not be! let Minsc and Boo take their chances here. Do not abandon Imoen to this place.",,1,MINSCJ
49579,Minsc,Poisoned and dying! The tragedy of it sings in my skull! We must hurry and deliver this man to safe harbor!,,1,MINSCJ
49586,Jaheira,You would leave a person in obvious distress to his own devices? I would have expected better of you.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
49599,Jaheira,"But it is the truth, is it not? I am a Harper myself, and we simply wish to be treated as guests. you did bring you your poisoned friend, after all.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49606,Jaheira,"That was foolish! The Harpers could have helped you. *sigh* But I suppose you will do as you always have, stubborn person.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49608,Jaheira,"I am a Harper, friend, and I think I see where this is heading... Is all this really necessary?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49609,Jaheira,"*sigh* If the Harpers have asked this task to judge your worthiness, then there is no way around it. Let us proceed and be done with these ""creatures.""",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49612,Jaheira,"Hmm, I am surprised they are letting us in, even after all this. I warn you, be polite. Our reason for being here is questionable enough as it is.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49627,Jaheira,"Hmmm... it's nice to know there's a ""softer"" and ""sweeter"" side to you... ""Eddie.""",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49631,Jaheira,"And all feared the Slayer, for it walked like a mortal, but in its wake there came murder, and in the future, there was death.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49778,Jaheira,"This is a dark place to meet this woman, and I sense an unnaturalness about her that is disturbing to me. Step carefully.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49783,Jaheira,"How does she know of our link to the Shadow Thieves? And what would they think of this meeting? Be careful, our lives may hang in the balance.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49784,Minsc,Such an offer from this woman sends chills up and down my spine like angry weasels... but you will know what to do. Even Boo is confident of this.,,1,MINSCJ
49812,Jaheira,"Boldly said, creature, yet you do not face us. you has been underestimated by far better. You will rue the day of conflict when it comes, I think.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49821,Minsc,"It is an option that bears no questioning! you is a champion of good, just as we all are! Always must we take the choice of righteousness!",,1,MINSCJ
49833,Minsc,No! Tell me this is not so! No heroes would commit such an act! I could never look Boo in the eyes again if I took part in such a thing!,,1,MINSCJ
49840,Minsc,"My hamster's heart is crushed that you have fallen so far! How could this be? It is my fault, all mine, for letting it happen!",,1,MINSCJ
49843,Minsc,"I... I must leave to drown in my sorrows. If you pick yourself up, I shall be in that Copper Coronet. It seemed like a grand place for adventure, oh yes!",,1,MINSCJ
49847,Minsc,"This is more like it! A rescue from the hostage-takers! All shall quiver in the wake of our righteous fury! Yes, Boo, show them how they will quiver!",,1,MINSCJ
49856,Minsc,We will charge into the midst of the den of thieves and fling them about like pancakes! All that is glory shall be ours! And then breakfast.,,1,MINSCJ
49871,Minsc,"Those who bury the living must be buried by our righteous fury! Woe betide those who would flout justice! So says Minsc, though ""betide"" was Boo's word.",,1,MINSCJ
49886,Jaheira,"Step slowly, you do not look well at all. How do you feel?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49909,Minsc,You would keep this woman a prisoner? Boo is not convinced that this is right. I agree that it smells of evil. Bad you! Bad!,,1,MINSCJ
49911,Minsc,"So the woman is freed? What need is there to collect a reward from the man? Are we not heroes, you and Boo and I? This is most confusing.",,1,MINSCJ
49913,Jaheira,"You have your money, but you could have avoided the inevitable reputation of a kidnapper. Sometimes I think you act without due consideration.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49920,Jaheira,"Are you well? I am growing very worried about you, you know. I should not like to lose you in this evil place.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49924,Jaheira,"Your lips move, but there is no sound. you!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49953,Jaheira,"Nature is not so vindictive, fool. It cares not who prostrates before it, it cares only that the balance is maintained.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49963,Jaheira,"This is the hilt of a long sword. It appears to have been forged by a fine craftsman, even though the blade was broken off long ago and the pommel is obviously missing a large gem. STATISTICS: Weight: 2",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49968,Minsc,"It is more dangerous to call Boo a vermin, as he may leap upon you and show you his true warrior spirit. Nothing can contend with the might of an angry hamster!",,1,MINSCJ
49969,Jaheira,You would have killed me if I had let you. You would have left me to rot in this place.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
49974,Jaheira,"I'm not sure you should try to control it. We must distance you from it, not embrace it. We will make do despite the danger.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49975,Jaheira,"No, you should not be alone during this. We will get through, I am sure. We just have to keep going, no matter what comes.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
49976,Jaheira,You are not the only one affected by this! It is so hard to see you...,,1,JAHEIRAJ
49977,Jaheira,"please, let's just keep moving. We'll get through, I'm sure of it. Really.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
50006,Jaheira,Are you well? It would only be fitting to take some time to rest. You have been through quite an ordeal.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
50011,Jaheira,"Very well, but keep me apprised of your condition. Imoen supposedly went through the same ritual, but she did not seem to suffer from sudden attacks like that.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
50013,Jaheira,"That is troubling. I do not know what effect having the ritual had on you, but it does appear to be different from what Imoen suffered. Odd.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
50037,Jaheira,"I am glad that you have chosen this course. This cult stinks of wrongness, an affront against nature that must be stopped!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
50041,Minsc,"An assault on the most foul and evil of creatures! Such a victory shall make us heroes to be sung of throughout the land! Glory will be ours, oh yes!",,1,MINSCJ
50053,Jaheira,You align yourself with a temple that threatens its followers? You would bow down before a vindictive god? You are strange indeed.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
50093,Minsc,The priest turns on us! For shame! Boo will gnaw on his eye sockets for this travesty!,,1,MINSCJ
50100,Jaheira,"Hold, do not be foolish! You there... how can we be certain of your innocence? Why are you here if you are no longer members of the cult?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
50106,Minsc,"We are stopping now? Why are we stopping? We are heroes, and heroes must face the final enemy and win over all!",,1,MINSCJ
50121,Jaheira,"This... this is the same child-killing gnome from Baldur's Gate! I remember! For the greater balance, his head must be brought to the authorities!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
50122,Minsc,"Boo remembers! Baldur's Gate! Neb the child murderer! You die, gnome, you die! RAAAAAGGGGGHHHH!",,1,MINSCJ
50124,Jaheira,"I... I understand. It is an avatar of a faded god, left guarding an item that has waned in power. Loathing has replaced the worship of his followers. A lingering fate.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
50130,Minsc,Tiny has met a god before this?,,1,MINSCJ
50301,Minsc,"Boo is my stalwart companion, and he says that if you must wear the skins of a dead animal around your neck, the evil sharp-toothed weasel is a good choice.",,1,MINSCJ
50343,Minsc,"Minsc and Boo fight with swords and teeth for goodness, not for countries. We are heroes, not soldiers, funny man.",,1,MINSCJ
50416,Minsc,"He attacks? Such a display of wrongness fills even Boo with disgust! For my hamster, I must land a blow for goodness!",,1,MINSCJ
50534,Jaheira,"I have no love for drow, or for this drow in particular... but it seems that she has done nothing to deserve this fate other than simply be a drow. This is not justice.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
50537,Minsc,They... they will not burn the pretty elf? There must be no burning if she has committed no crime! This is not justice! we stop this travesty!,,1,MINSCJ
50555,Jaheira,"Is that what you see as justice? I sensed great sadness behind her darkness. With balance, she might have been... well, who knows?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
50557,Minsc,"We do not rescue her? What was her crime? Maybe darker elves are not all good, but surely not all are totally evil? I am... confused. What does Boo think?",,1,MINSCJ
50566,Jaheira,"Truth be known, I am not opposed to having Viconia travel with us. Remember, though, that many will think less of us simply because she is here.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
50578,Minsc,"We have saved her, and she is our responsibility. What if she was captured again? Neither Boo nor I could live with ourselves. No, she must come.",,1,MINSCJ
50639,Jaheira,Are you... yourself? That was... the Slayer! You became a form of the avatar of Bhaal... but the god is dead...,,1,JAHEIRAJ
50640,Jaheira,this is not right at all.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
50660,Jaheira,"we had best move quickly! The mages you have let loose will need direction, or they will be impossible to control.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
50670,Minsc,Boo is worried that these inmates will harm themselves. We should see that they are safe and make sure they each have a hamster of their own.,,1,MINSCJ
50671,Minsc,That last part was my idea.,,1,MINSCJ
50957,Jaheira,"We must be subservient. To them, we are lesser drow and no doubt under suspicion. Any sign of disobedience would bring scrutiny upon us.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
50958,Jaheira,"The drow have a harsh culture, one I am not overly familiar with. We must harden our hearts if we are to blend in. The alternative is discovery and death.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
51254,Jaheira,"Just what are you on to? You think I am blind, not to see your foolish behavior with the drow woman? Why would you play such an idiotic game...? Do you not remember our situation?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
51261,Jaheira,Jealous of a simple drow that turns her eyes up at you? Is your opinion of me so low? I merely think that flirtations will gain nothing and endanger us all.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
51264,Jaheira,It is a foolish one. Drow enjoy neither affection nor intense attraction. Sex is nothing but a game to them. To indulge would be... disappointing.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
51265,Jaheira,"Oh? I am disappointed. Indulge your carnality, by all means, if it means so much to you. I shall say no more on that subject or any other.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
52240,Jaheira,"You spent quite some time in the drow woman's chambers. Care to elaborate what you were about, as if I did not know?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
52246,Jaheira,"I suppose that is true enough, although I can think of several lies you might have tried for our sake. But I trust you enough. Let us just... move on.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
52247,Jaheira,Hmph. You are just the sort to lie to me about this. And that this makes me uncomfortable is even worse. I think I prefer to be on my own for a time.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
52248,Jaheira,"I know the purpose. Simple self-gratification, or do you maintain there was no way to avoid the situation? Ahhh, enough... I do not want to hear any more.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
52249,Jaheira,"I am sorry too, and disappointed, but I suppose it could not be avoided... with you being male and in this guise. I shall... attempt to forget about it.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
52250,Jaheira,"No? Very well. I shall endeavor to keep my shrewish opinions to myself, on this and all other matters regarding us.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
52251,Jaheira,Hmmm... out so soon? Did the drow woman not dig her claws into you successfully? That is good. I shudder to think what might have happened otherwise.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
52288,Minsc,"True heroes demand no reward, and Boo knows you to be a true hero! We need only know what foes we are to face before the boot-stomping can begin!",,1,MINSCJ
52293,Jaheira,"How can you refuse so coldly? I will not stand idly by. Nalia... we will aid you, as will you, I am sure. What is the problem, precisely?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
52295,Minsc,No! Say it cannot be so! we must rescue the nice man's child and be off! Unless... unless you have some plan? Minsc is confused.,,1,MINSCJ
52306,Minsc,No! Has you truly fallen so far? A glorious rescue has turned into a nightmare of epic proportion! Minsc and Boo will stop you!,,1,MINSCJ
52607,Minsc,Boo knows! Do not stow thrones in grass houses!,,1,MINSCJ
55186,Minsc,"The evil wizard is dead! Once again, Boo and Minsc and you emerge as victorious heroes! Much rejoicing and celebrating must be commencing soon!",,1,MINSCJ
55188,Jaheira,"A bitter end to a terrible man. We did well, I think, but I am not certain that all has been restored to as it was. Do you feel any different?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
55208,Minsc,"Oh, such a glorious death in battle for Minsc and Boo! We were well on our way to the great fields and halls of Rashemen, but we felt you needing us, so we came!",MINSC87,1,MINSCJ
55210,Jaheira,"It... it is not finished, is it? This is death... and your strange power has dragged me here with you....So be it then. We stand together until the end.",JAHEIRD3,1,JAHEIRAJ
55650,Jaheira,I understand plenty already! This place reeks of corruption and deceit!,,1,JAHEIRAJ
55668,Minsc,"This young minstrel has lost his wits and his songs? Minds are common enough, but tunes of merit are few and far between.",,1,MINSCJ
55671,Jaheira,"Rest, child. None of this group shall harm you.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
55672,Jaheira,Oh? Is that what those retching noises were? I thought that perhaps there was a wounded seal somewhere onboard giving birth.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
55677,Jaheira,"Okay, I'm not quite so concerned about this little freak. Rule as you will, little tyrant, just as long as it is from a cell.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
55680,Minsc,"Yes! Such fire and conviction! A pity there are no actual enemies to warrant the screaming, but good show anyway. Boo applauds!",,1,MINSCJ
55684,Minsc,"It is okay to come out now, Boo. The pale woman is gone. You can stop shivering too. You are a warrior hamster, so be brave! Brave!",,1,MINSCJ
55686,Jaheira,"I suppose we could expect no less from a simple pirate. Begone with you then, scoundrel. No doubt you would only bring us more trouble here than we need.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
55689,Minsc,All good peoples hang their head in shame! We are betrayed! The sailor man brings the vampires back amongst us... there shall be a mighty reckoning for this!,,1,MINSCJ
55693,Jaheira,These are the same creatures we fought when we entered the lair of the vampire that was aligned against your own guild. Bodhi must be nearby indeed.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
55694,Minsc,"I do not think Boo is too thrilled about you borrowing his face. He only has the one. You don't hurt those you mirror, do you?",,1,MINSCJ
55698,Jaheira,"Do you spend all your time in the guise of others, child? Do you not take solace in the balance of your true self?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
55726,Jaheira,War? War amongst the elves? What could that mean? How could even Irenicus start such a thing? That would bring nothing but ruin!,,1,JAHEIRAJ
55740,Jaheira,"As much as I should not trust his advice, he may have a point. There are powerful mages above who may be the difference between life and death.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
55763,Minsc,"Ughh, my head spins. So many quick words from so many small sources. Countersong, Boo. Relax my frazzled nerves.",,1,MINSCJ
55767,Minsc,What does everyone stare at? Boo's churring calms me down. See?,,1,MINSCJ
55776,Minsc,"Yes! Revenge! Revenge for precious Dynaheir! Tremble, wizard, for the mighty Boo will have your eyes! RAAAARRRRGHH!",,1,MINSCJ
55779,Jaheira,"What revenge do *you* have, wizard? You killed my Khalid with no more thought than one would give to a fly! I shall have *my* revenge! Nature's fury shall strike you down!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
55784,Minsc,"That's a much shorter interjection than Boo has become used to, Jan. Are you ill?",,1,MINSCJ
55788,Jaheira,"You think us fools? You knew your ship was scuttled when you first spoke to us, didn't you? You seek to use us somehow!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
55809,Jaheira,She sees the universe unrestricted. It is amazing that she manages to be as lucid as she is.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
55813,Jaheira,"And what would you have to do with that, Edwin? Perhaps if ego were all that was required.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
55819,Minsc,No! No collar! I will not be collared by the smelly fishmen! My warrior spirit will not bear such a thing!,,1,MINSCJ
55821,Jaheira,I should have known. Once again your peculiar destiny has drawn us into something. Even the shark gods flounder in anticipation of your arrival.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
55825,Minsc,"Boo too has small teeth compared to fish-men. But they hurt just the same when they latch onto the eyes, yes sir!",,1,MINSCJ
55840,Jaheira,"I have never known you to be so judgmental, paladin. Surely you do not label all sahuagin so? Condemn them all to death and you are no better than they.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
55859,Jaheira,"Must it come to slaughter, sahuagin? Your priestesses speak of your entire people needing your blood... Have you attempted to resolve this with the king peacefully?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
55861,Minsc,"My skin may not have scales, but it has seen many suns come and go. Boo thinks you could use some sun too. Then you might not smell so much like wet laundry.",,1,MINSCJ
55876,Jaheira,"Well, Viconia. It would seem you carry less weight than you thought. He questions your worth, rightfully so.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
55882,Minsc,"Don't worry, Aerie. I'm here to protect my witch. Boo too, though I think he would leap to protect anyone in distress. It's his heroic nature, you know.",,1,MINSCJ
55889,Jaheira,"A most underhanded maneuver. Although I am sure it is no less than Phaere might have planned for us. There is an ironic justice in this, no?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
55892,Minsc,"Boo bristles at his words. I don't know the language, but he is insulting us for certain!",,1,MINSCJ
55895,Jaheira,So... a war? Open battle between the drow and the surface has not occurred in... eons. With a greater demon to back them... I truly wonder why Irenicus would do this.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
55913,Jaheira,"You would commit such a sacrilege against nature? Had I known, I would never have accompanied you! No, I will not let this be!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
55915,Minsc,I cannot believe my ears! You would stand against all that is good and right? You shall suffer a terrible vengeance for this!,,1,MINSCJ
55921,Jaheira,"As much as I despise this form, it does seem to have captivated our friend here. He seems fearful.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
55922,Minsc,Yes! Hello! Minsc is a drow! And Boo is a shadow hamster!,,1,MINSCJ
55934,Jaheira,"Despite what she says, we may be able to use this situation to our advantage. Perhaps there is no need to kill Solaufein. Consider this, at least.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
55948,Jaheira,"Drow roaming the surface, even the most noble, should expect an occasional misunderstanding. I am sure this can be worked out... I suggest you try.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
55966,Jaheira,This drow is well respected by the Harpers. I will not assist you fighting him. I will return to Athkatla; consider your idiocy before we speak again.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
55968,Minsc,"Another drow who speaks strange words! Even Boo bristles at his obvious lies! If you fights, then so does Minsc! Prepare for liberal butt-kickings!",,1,MINSCJ
55997,Jaheira,An excellent idea. Adding Drizzt and his companions to our battle against Bodhi will certainly tip the scales. You show great wisdom.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
56009,Jaheira,"I know of this one, from the Harpers. A drow of good alignment and heroic reputation. He is deserving of respect.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
56017,Minsc,"Ooh, another drow! I begin to see them everywhere, ever since the Underdark! They are so vicious even Boo cowers. What will we do?",,1,MINSCJ
56018,Minsc,I do not cause trouble! I merely seek it out and put the bootheels of justice to it! Ask Boo!,,1,MINSCJ
56041,Jaheira,"A fine sentiment, Cernd, though we may be forced into more trouble than we wish.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
56067,Minsc,"Boo is impressed, Korgan. You remember well to act like drow.",,1,MINSCJ
56080,Jaheira,That was close. We must make an effort to act as we appear.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
56083,Jaheira,The Seldarine? The collection of elven gods led by Corellon Larethian? How would he ever propose to join such ranks? Mad! Mad!,,1,JAHEIRAJ
56085,Jaheira,"Your soul is borrowed, and it shall be returned. You are a blight upon nature, and you shall be destroyed!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
56086,Minsc,"For Dynaheir and all fallen comrades, for what is good and right, for all these things shall Minsc and Boo fall upon you today! And we shall taste victory, evil man!",,1,MINSCJ
56087,Jaheira,"Edwin, in some another time... some other place, such a comment would get you a beating of mythic proportions. It may yet.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
56092,Minsc,"Neither do we, right, Boo?",,1,MINSCJ
56093,Minsc,What's so funny?,,1,MINSCJ
56111,Jaheira,"No more platitudes, Irenicus. You have taken much from all of us. Now you die your final death!",JAHEIRD2,1,JAHEIRAJ
56112,Minsc,"I grow tired of shouting battle cries when fighting this mage. Boo will finish his eyeballs once and for all so he does not rise again! Evil, meet my sword! SWORD, MEET EVIL!",MINSC86,1,MINSCJ
56124,Minsc,"Worry not, Viconia! Minsc and Boo stand at the ready to protect! Right, Boo?",,1,MINSCJ
56127,Minsc,No! You will not attack the small dark ones! Minsc and Boo will not allow it! And I hope no other will either!,,1,MINSCJ
56130,Jaheira,I will not let you do this! You will not murder those that beg for aid! Who will follow me?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
56152,Minsc,"And then Minsc will disrupt them with his bootheel! Yes, speak more of this evil-smashing partnership!",,1,MINSCJ
56154,Jaheira,It would appear that neither of us have much of a choice in the matter. We must trust one another.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
56162,Jaheira,"Of course, my Lady Adalon. do keep quiet.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
56165,Jaheira,It is unfortunate that they did not offend you in some way. We might have been spared the headache of this journey if they had to face an angry silver.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
56170,Minsc,Boo shakes with disbelief! Such a crime will not go unanswered!,,1,MINSCJ
56174,Jaheira,To become such a hated thing... I do not look forward to that.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
56176,Jaheira,"You should have made more of an effort. We have an obligation to destroy you, as if we needed more reasons.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
56198,Minsc,Boo would have found her wherever she tried to put her evil foot! That's what we do!,,1,MINSCJ
56409,Minsc,"Irenicus is the most vile of villains if he dared destroy a whole city! I can't believe that, and I have believed some amazing things, let me tell you!",,1,MINSCJ
56413,Jaheira,Knock him on the head? It is obvious this lout has no compassion for others and no inclination of how nature must be protected. Ignore him.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
56417,Jaheira,"you can't seriously consider poisoning this font. If there is evil there, we must cleanse it. To destroy it is sacrilege! I will not allow it!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
56420,Minsc,"Groves are wonderful... you wouldn't really poison one, would you? Boo suggests that perhaps you are tricking this evil little man. Smart thinking, I agree.",,1,MINSCJ
56425,Jaheira,"No, no! This is evil! You poison nature itself! I shall not partake in this... who stands with me?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
56429,Minsc,This is the evil killer who takes skins that do not belong to him! We have discovered him! We must take the bootheel to his ways!,,1,MINSCJ
56453,Jaheira,"These people are slaves, mentally as well as physically, controlled despite themselves. All we can offer them, unfortunately, is a quick death.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
56457,Jaheira,"There are many who easily sidestep laws through wealth. Perhaps, in this case, it would be best to see why the law has failed so.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
56458,Minsc,"To decide between justice and honor! Oh, it is a conundrum that would tie even Boo up in knots. I do not envy you. My decisions are usually easier than this.",,1,MINSCJ
56461,Jaheira,"The law may not be able to do anything, Anomen, but such men as this Saerk always trip over their own schemes. If he is responsible, he will pay, as you say.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
56465,Jaheira,"Too many of the wealthy escape justice, yes. If you are sure that Saerk is responsible for the death of your sister, then we must ensure he pays dearly!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
56470,Jaheira,By... by the gods! You foolish man! Can you say that this young woman was a murderer as well? You have murdered an innocent!,,1,JAHEIRAJ
56471,Minsc,No! Minsc did not come here to kill young girls! You cannot tell us that the young girl was anything but innocent! This is not right!,,1,MINSCJ
56474,Jaheira,I have the feeling we are intruding on a very private matter. I feel uncomfortable with our intrusion; perhaps we should leave...,,1,JAHEIRAJ
56481,Jaheira,"A fair line easily used by servants of the wizard themselves. We have been imprisoned and worse, and given many reasons to distrust strangers we encounter.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
56482,Minsc,"We serve no evil mages, no sir! But Boo looks upon you with suspicion, little man. How is it you come to be here? Never have I seen Boo's whiskers quiver so!",,1,MINSCJ
56483,Imoen,"Athkatla? That's... the City of Coin, right? A merchant city in Amn. We come from the Sword Coast, a ways to the north. Why do you think we're in Athkatla?",,1,IMOENJ
56484,Minsc,"Then you too know the hardship of being set into a maze like a helpless hamster! We are comrades in peril! Boo asks what you propose we do next, little man.",,1,MINSCJ
56487,Jaheira,You have extorted a payment from Raelis in return for our help. I do not agree with this decision... it smacks of selfish greed.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
56492,Minsc,"What is this? Minsc and Boo were just getting into this wonderful story when it was sadly interrupted. A work of mastery, this is!",,1,MINSCJ
56498,Jaheira,"We must be calm. Vengeance will only bring conflict with the guard. To help Nalia, we must prove that our cause is just... there is no other way.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
56499,Minsc,"Someone has rattled the little one's brains? Hmm, I know how she feels. If this was done on purpose, he deserves a mighty kick in his posterior at the least!",,1,MINSCJ
56508,Jaheira,"A mind flayer? Here? A spy perhaps, using its psionic powers to keep its secret. Strange that Jan's mad uncle should be aware of its presence.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
56514,Minsc,Helping others is good! What a nice little girl you are. Would you like to see my Boo? I think he approves of you too.,,1,MINSCJ
56515,Minsc,Helping others is good! What a nice little girl you are. Would you like to see my Boo? I think he approves of you too.,,1,MINSCJ
56516,Jaheira,"You speak as if unaware of class distinction, and yet your manner exudes it. A sign of immaturity... perhaps adventuring is not the place for you.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
56517,Jaheira,"You speak as if unaware of class distinction, and yet your manner exudes it. A sign of immaturity... good, then, that you is sending you ahead.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
56528,Jaheira,You dare reprimand those who have died defending you? Even now they strive to protect you from evil you don't even understand! You could have been dead!,,1,JAHEIRAJ
56551,Jaheira,"I have no fear for his well-being, monster.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
56599,Jaheira,"You have saved me, and I am in your debt once more. I am... I am glad you risked so much to come for me.",JAHEIRE8,1,JAHEIRAP
56617,Jaheira,"I see. Very well, I shall be on my guard. Do we continue now? There are more important things to do than sit here talking about things that... don't matter.",,1,JAHEIRAP
56625,Jaheira,Very well. Let's waste no more time.,,1,JAHEIRAP
56626,Jaheira,I... I would say as much about you. I will stand at your side as long as I am able... if you will have me there and return the favor.,,1,JAHEIRAP
56629,Jaheira,I shall enjoy some quiet time once this is done. We have had very little time to speak...,,1,JAHEIRAP
56630,Jaheira,"I'm sorry, I should not be so swept up in this. Let's go.",,1,JAHEIRAP
56675,Minsc,"I don't wish to alarm you, but Boo is absolutely fretting about your condition. Are you well? Fear in Boo is uncommon, and usually weasel-caused.",,1,MINSCJ
56679,Minsc,"We can rest if you wish. I do not understand what Irenicus did, but Boo has said that it was traumatic, and I will guard if we must stay here a while.",,1,MINSCJ
56680,Minsc,"That is good. I will guard if you need to rest. It is the least I can do, since I could not stop Irenicus.",,1,MINSCJ
56682,Minsc,"Then Minsc and Boo will turn their attentions to more important things, like staying alive. We should get moving if you are through with your headache.",,1,MINSCJ
56698,Imoen,"There's people dead all over, and the fighting is still going on. I could hear it. Are you going to get moving, or do I leave without you?",,1,IMOEN10
56877,Jaheira,"Where? Where exactly is it being put to good use? We are not to be played with, Linvail. I should like to see results, and I should like to see them soon.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
56881,Minsc,"Boo does not think so, despite your kind words. You smell of treachery. Prove me wrong or face the boot!",,1,MINSCJ
56886,Minsc,You'd have bought a trip to the graveyard if you had spent the money we needed to rescue Imoen! Minsc and Boo would see to that!,,1,MINSCJ
56899,Jaheira,"Oh, how generous. Do you expect that to compensate while you delay our more important concerns? We have friends in need of rescue and vengeance both!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
56906,Jaheira,And vengeance!,,1,JAHEIRAJ
57066,Jaheira,"I see. You must be the rogue, Jarlaxle, that was mentioned to us, yes?",,1,JAHEIRAJ
57396,Jaheira,"A poor thing. We could have done better by these people with minimal effort. It is a better fate than what the drow had in store, however.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
57455,Jaheira,"No. ""Veldrin"" would not be interested in such diversions, male. I... as a female, I command you to stand away from him. Slug.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
57740,Minsc,"When all others stand numb, it falls to Minsc and Boo to make comment. you...",,1,MINSCJ
57741,Minsc,Boo just soiled my backpack.,,1,MINSCJ
57901,Minsc,"Boo does not favor the odds, but I have no doubt we will succeed!",,1,MINSCJ
57903,Jaheira,"Yes, declare your loyalty, Viconia. When you eventually betray us, I will hold your statement up as proof of the untrustworthy nature of your kind.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
57905,Minsc,Boo would have sensed any treachery long ago! She fights well with us!,,1,MINSCJ
57911,Jaheira,"Cernd, I would normally bow to your wisdom, but in this matter, I think you are... mistaken. I make no protest; I merely wish to state my opinion.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
58056,IDRYAD3,May the forest always open a path for you!,,1,IDRYAD3
58132,Jaheira,"We are bought off yet again. I do not deny that they are the best chance we have to find our quarry, but we had best do their little chores quickly.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
58133,Jaheira,"Thank you for your opinion, Korgan. I'll just place it over here where it can collect flies all on its own.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
58137,Minsc,Boo concurs! We must hurry and dispense with this errandry so we can get to the fighting of greater evils more worthy of my bootprint!,,1,MINSCJ
58138,Minsc,"Minsc and Boo will protect your street, Aerie! You will cross it for your pleasure, not for fear of it!",,1,MINSCJ
58164,Jaheira,"You baffle me sometimes, Cernd, but I bow to your wisdom on this matter.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
58179,Minsc,Then let us get going! Boo and I have several talents we will unleash upon it!,,1,MINSCJ
58186,Jaheira,"Not just thieves, but traitorous thieves. Our associations sink ever lower in Aran's service. Let's get this over with.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
58187,Jaheira,"I have heard some in the Harpers speak of it. It is more than a prison or supposed asylum; it is a place to forget people that are ""troublesome.""",,1,JAHEIRAJ
58198,Jaheira,"Long ago, I promised to assist you if your adopted father fell. That promise has not expired, nor has your worthiness. I stand with you if you will have me.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
58199,Minsc,Minsc owes much to the killer of Dynaheir! I stand with you! Nowhere shall I go until the heel of justice has been firmly imprinted once and for all into the wizard's evil backside! Nowhere!,,1,MINSCJ
58205,Yoshimo,"I can't fight it, I can't. I was in his service first, and all those that follow him must undergo a geas. I was willing at the time... but now...",,1,YOSHIMOX
58206,Yoshimo,"Do you... do you know what happens when you try to defy a geas? It hurts... It hurts and then you die. His spells are powerful, so powerful.",,1,YOSHIMOX
58216,Yoshimo,"I believe it does... I can wither and die for failing to kill you, or I can fall in battle and pray that my heart will find purchase with Ilmater.",,1,YOSHIMOX
58217,Yoshimo,"Yes, yes, you can. I have but two options. A slow and painful death for failing to kill you, or a swift one in battle, and may my heart find purchase with Ilmater for these sins.",,1,YOSHIMOX
58221,Yoshimo,,,1,YOSHIMOX
58247,Jaheira,It is not necessary to say anything. I know what comes next... I know what may happen. To either of us.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
58248,Jaheira,We have been through too much to let that stop what you must do. For all the pain that losing Khalid brought... I would not give up our years of good works.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
58249,Jaheira,Let us regain your soul and make you whole again. And what comes after... comes after. I look forward to it... should the gods prove willing.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
58492,Imoen,"say we won't look back. I don't care if he can ""tap the power"" or access whatever avatar stuff. We've gotta get away from all this death.",,1,IMOENJ
58496,Imoen,Means a lot to hear that. I can't stand all these shadows...,,1,IMOENJ
58497,Imoen,"I appreciate that, but I doubt he meant you any good either. Didn't spare you the knives any more than me. Come on, I gotta get away from all these shadows.",,1,IMOENJ
58498,Imoen,"Let it go, please? Whoever he is and whatever he can do, above it all, he's a vile bastard that's hurt us both. Come on, I gotta get away from all this death.",,1,IMOENJ
58502,Imoen,"He said something like ""releasing power within you so it could be used,"" but if it means taking part in horrible things... I don't like this place. Can we go?",,1,IMOENJ
58503,Imoen,"I don't care if he could make us three ogres strong, I have to get out of this place. It bothers me. Makes me think I see... things.",,1,IMOENJ
58504,Imoen,"As if I need another reminder. I don't care what power this guy thinks he can tap in you, he's just sick to the core. We can't ever look back.",,1,IMOENJ
58518,Jaheira,"No, Valygar, we shall not give up on you. The Cowled Wizards believe much if they think to use everyone as they wish. You will receive nothing this day, mage!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
58519,Minsc,No! We do not abandon comrades! Never could I look Boo in the face again after such a thing! We shall give the evil wizard a certain boot-kicking instead!,,1,MINSCJ
58719,Jaheira,"You will hear the name ""traitor"" many more times today, Yoshimo, but let me be the first among the group to spit it at you!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
58756,Minsc,"A slap in the face of our trust! A sword to the heart of our confidence! A boot to the prunes of our friendship! Perhaps I go too far, but Boo is absolutely incensed!",,1,MINSCJ
58764,Yoshimo,Don't make this harder than it already is. I can't help you. There are circumstances that you are not aware of.,,1,YOSHIMOX
58768,Yoshimo,"Yes, yes, it is the coward's way out. What of it? What choice do I have when the alternative is death, no matter where I go or what I do?",,1,YOSHIMOX
58769,Yoshimo,"I would not deliver a friend to a devil for mere coin! I had... no choice! Death would be my payment if I failed, no matter where I went or what I did!",,1,YOSHIMOX
58770,Yoshimo,Death! Death no matter where I would go or what I would do! That is what awaited me if I failed. Can you understand that?,,1,YOSHIMOX
58771,Yoshimo,My service was promised long before I was called on to do this! I did not know what would come! I did not know what a filthy creature Irenicus truly was. I did not!,,1,YOSHIMOX
59069,Minsc,"Minsc and Boo are the greatest of warriors, small one! I will crush your foes into little foe-shaped chunky bits! Who dares pick on you? Just point the way!",,1,MINSCJ
59071,Minsc,"No foes? I am relieved. I trust those who prey on children no farther than they can be thrown, even if I manage to throw them pretty far, and throw them I shall!",,1,MINSCJ
59072,Minsc,"What? Boo is outraged! See his fury! It's small, so look close. Trust me, it's there. What is wrong with your village, small one? How can we heroes help?",,1,MINSCJ
59073,Minsc,"Minsc has been inside out and angry before, and it is never a good thing. Sometimes it frightens even Boo.",,1,MINSCJ
59075,Minsc,"Oh! Minsc has never been crazy, no sir. Being inside out was bad enough! Is there more, little boy?",,1,MINSCJ
59076,Minsc,"Then heroes are certainly needed! Heroes like Minsc and Boo and you! Where is your village, small one? Together we will save the day!",,1,MINSCJ
59078,Minsc,"Nothing removes fear better than a good sword and a swift kick in the evil! We shall go to your village and do what heroes do, right?",,1,MINSCJ
59088,Minsc,"There is always time to save the day! Don't worry, small one, we will go to your village as soon as I restore you to their senses. That is my job.",,1,MINSCJ
59089,Minsc,Kicking the posterior of evil is never a fool's errand! Hmm is not their usual heroic self today. An evil influence? Or have their thoughts wandered elsewhere?,,1,MINSCJ
59090,Minsc,"Since you is out of their mind, I must step up as a hero should. We go to your village as soon as you is better. So swear Minsc and Boo.",,1,MINSCJ
59091,Minsc,Er... Boo wonders what you need a warrior for when you have no foes?,,1,MINSCJ
59093,Minsc,"Boo is curious and keeps bringing up the question of when we will travel to the Imnesvale village, and I heartily agree! We are heroes, and they are in need of heroes-it is a match even Minsc can see!",,1,MINSCJ
59094,Minsc,"We must go where evil is in most need of a beating, so Minsc will leave that decision up to you. Still... we must not disappoint the little boy.",,1,MINSCJ
59095,Minsc,"Did Minsc miss something? Did we already go and save the Imnesvale village? Boo demands that it is not so, but I cannot remember. Surely we would not shirk out heroic duty for so long! It cannot be!",,1,MINSCJ
59421,Minsc,"We come because the little boy, Delon, said that there was evil here in need of a butt-kicking! And good for us that we have our boots on, yes, sir!",,1,MINSCJ
59423,Minsc,"No, we can't leave this place without having destroyed all evil! Tell Boo this is not so! Do not destroy a young hamster's innocence!",,1,MINSCJ
59424,Minsc,Wolves? Ogres? Witches? Oh my! It is too much for Minsc's poor head to comprehend! Which of these are evil? The edge of my sword shall find the truth!,,1,MINSCJ
59425,Minsc,"Oh, most glorious day! One step closer we come to being true heroes, yes indeedy! Even little Boo's fur stands on end from his anticipation!",,1,MINSCJ
59542,Minsc,Minsc agrees! It would be the essence of epic heroing! Dead dragons should litter our path wherever we go!,,1,MINSCJ
59897,Minsc,(Minsc is charmed by the dryads and will not speak to you. You shall have to agree to help them if you want Minsc back.),,1,MINSCP
60839,Minsc,"Enough, Boo tires of this debate. It is old and stale and pointless.",,1,BMINSC
60851,Minsc,"Bah, omens are for those that pay attention to their surroundings, not for such as we, right, Boo?",,1,MINSCJ
60868,Minsc,"Anyway, go out of city that way... Keep on the road, turn right at big church, and you will be out.",,1,MINSCJ
60876,Minsc,"Boo says not to blame myself, but Boo is a hamster and not as concerned with honor.",,1,MINSCJ
60880,Minsc,"Actually, this changes very little. Minsc is happy.",,1,MINSCJ
60881,Minsc,And perhaps my Boo as well...,,1,MINSCJ
60882,Minsc,And a good sword...,,1,MINSCJ
60883,Minsc,"Ooh! And the occasional buffing, for the armor, you understand.",,1,MINSCJ
60891,Jaheira,"I no more want the trip than you do, so I will not force and I will not leave, but I cannot rest easy until we go.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
60892,Jaheira,"If you wish, Dermin, you may return whence you came with the message that ""Jaheira the Harper"" is dead.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
60893,Jaheira,"Perhaps we will meet again, but I shall not look forward to it!",,1,JAHEIRAJ
61012,Imoen,"Minsc and Jaheira are just northeast of us, trapped in cells sorta like yours. We should free them and then find some gear.",,1,IMOEN10
61013,Minsc,"No, this cannot be! The murderer of Dynaheir flees from righteous butt-kicking vengeance! And he takes Imoen with him too!",,1,MINSCJ
61014,Minsc,"Something must be done! We must find this evil wizard! All that is goodness cries out for this! Even little Boo, although he cannot cry out quite so loudly.",,1,MINSCJ
61015,Jaheira,I find it odd that this Irenicus would leave of his own volition. And why take Imoen when it is you he is so obviously interested in? Perhaps he expects us to give chase?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
61016,Jaheira,"We must step carefully then. We know little about him... whom he was fighting, who took him, or even where we are. We seem to be drawn into machinations not of our own making.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
61017,Minsc,No! We must go quickly and save our friend Imoen! The wizard may be leering over her evilly even now!,,1,MINSCJ
61018,Jaheira,"Do not be foolish, Minsc. We must know our enemies... and the extent of our danger here... before we rush into anything.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
61170,Jaheira,I would have expected better from you! You have let yourself fall too far... and I will accompany you no further. We will not meet again.,,1,JAHEIRAP
61171,Jaheira,"So. Your darker desires win over you fully. I have seen enough. Should we meet again, it shall be as opponents and naught else.",,1,JAHEIRAP
65582,Minsc,"Eh? Where have you brought us, Boo? I am duly impressed by your show of great powers, but a little forewarning would have been nice. No matter! Wherever evil treads, Minsc treads louder!",MINS2501,1,MINSC25A
65588,Minsc,"Ooo! Look who you have found, Boo, with your unerring sense of hamster direction! It is our good friend! A reunion of heroes! May all that is evil quiver before us like so much rancid jelly, ha!",MINS2502,1,MINSC25A
65592,Minsc,"Boo's nose twitches at your derision. See? Look at him twitch! If you are not careful, Boo will take us elsewhere to fight evil. I cannot control him when he gets like this!",,1,MINSC25A
65597,Minsc,"Boo is healthy and eager to resume the battle! It is why he has brought me here, no doubt. To team up with you again and send evil men scampering all weasel-like into what holes they can find!",,1,MINSC25A
65602,Minsc,"Why would I be surprised? Boo points, and I follow! Boo is the navigator, and I am the ship! Boo is the sword arm, and I am the sword! Well, I have a mighty sword arm too, but you get the picture.",,1,MINSC25A
65605,Minsc,"Very well. Boo and I will scour the area for evil. It cannot hide from us! Do you hear that, evil? We are coming for you!",,1,MINSC25A
65606,Minsc,Minsc and Boo stand at the ready! Yeah!,MINS2517,1,MINSC25A
65609,Minsc,"Good, good! Boo thought he was smelling nuts earlier. It is something that bears further investigation.",,1,MINSC25A
65610,Minsc,"Is this the end of our heroic tale? I would be sad at such goodbyes, but Boo says I should not be such a great smelly baby.",MINS2521,1,MINSC25P
65614,Minsc,"It shall be as you say! We shall wait for another reunion, Boo and I.",,1,MINSC25P
65615,Minsc,Aha! Our good friend returns! Minsc and Boo are ready to take the boot to the black butt of evil!,MINS2522,1,MINSC25P
65618,Minsc,"This must be a place of great importance, then. We shall guard it with our lives!",,1,MINSC25P
67912,Minsc,"No! Oh, say it is not so! We will no longer fight evil together? Oh... Boo will miss you. Forever shall we hang our heads in sadness in remembrance of our great butt-kicking friend.",MINS2519,1,MINSC25J
67913,Minsc,"Boo and I will say we knew the hero you. And people will of course not believe us. And maybe, they will look at us more strangely than they do now. Or maybe not.",MINS2520,1,MINSC25J
67994,Minsc,"*gasp* Such a thing would be a nightmare indeed-why, Minsc could not even fit into your tiny clothes! I have no wish to walk naked through these strange lands...",MINS2513,1,BMINSC25
68003,Minsc,"What is this? The puny gnome speaks with the wrath and rage of a Rashemaar warrior! Boo, I am confused...",,1,BMINSC25
68005,Minsc,"Can this be true? Am I but the sneaky little Jan inside Minsc's great, big body?...No! This is not right! Minsc is not Jan... Minsc is Minsc! Minsc is Minsc, Boo is Boo, and you are a naughty, naughty gnome!",,1,BMINSC25
68021,Minsc,"Your trick may have worked, tiny one, had Boo not saved me from my confusion. Boo thinks, therefore I am. Remember that before you tempt my wrath by trying to steal my hamster again!",,1,BMINSC25
68060,Minsc,"Korgaaan... Korgan, Korgan! Boo tells me that you have been staring at him. I fear your gaze is making him quite angry... you see how his tiny body trembles with the fury?",MINS2503,1,BMINSC25
68062,Minsc,"Minsc knows you are just joking. If Boo was in your belly, he might forget the ""miniature"" part of his giant space hamster size. Ho ho! That would be a messy end to your jests!",,1,BMINSC25
68067,Minsc,"Keldorn, yet again Boo and I are in awe with how deeply you plant the bootprint of justice on the villainous buttocks we encounter so often! Heh!",MINS2504,1,BMINSC25
68073,Minsc,And hamsters! Let us not forget Boo and his furry fury.,,1,BMINSC25
68076,Minsc,Boo? Boo? Where are you?,MINS2505,1,BMINSC25
68085,Minsc,"The tiny, tricky gnome! Minsc knows it was you who stole Boo! You cannot fool Minsc! What is that bulge moving about within your trousers?",,1,BMINSC25
68089,Minsc,"I hear Boo's frenzied squeaking! Ho-ho! He is growing angry, little man. Release Boo from your drawers lest his sharp teeth nibble on your naughty bits in his outrage!",,1,BMINSC25
68102,Minsc,"Ah, Minsc and Boo together again! Jan, you are not worthy of having a miniaturized giant space hamster scampering loose in your pants.",,1,BMINSC25
68136,Minsc,"This is because Rashemen is a very far ways away. Once, Boo kept track for me of the number of steps I have taken since beginning my dajemma, but *sigh* Boo has since forgotten.",MINS2511,1,BMINSC25
68138,Minsc,"Boo claims that the number is very large. Larger, maybe, than the number of butts that Minsc has deservedly kicked along the way. I find this hard to believe, even though Boo is usually very reliable in these matters.",,1,BMINSC25
68143,Minsc,"It is a wonderful place with many fields. It could only be better, maybe, if every ranger of the Berserker Lodge had his very own hamster. Just think of the implications!",,1,BMINSC25
68145,Minsc,"Yes, Dynaheir was a good Rashemaar witch. But I am not so certain that the witches have need of their own hamsters. Dynaheir never approved of Boo... she used to glare at Boo so, it frightened him sometimes.",,1,BMINSC25
68148,Minsc,Rodent? What do you imply about my hamster?,,1,BMINSC25
68164,Minsc,"Aerie! Boo has been mulling over a question for you. Never have I seen a hamster concentrate so! He has been so very quiet I thought perhaps I rolled over on him last night, which caused me great concern.",MINS2506,1,BMINSC25
68168,Minsc,"But Boo's question is of such a personal nature... well, the thought of it makes me blush right down to my buttocks.",,1,BMINSC25
68170,Minsc,"You are very insightful! Such bottling could lead to all sorts of un-hamster-like explosions! Well... Boo wonders why you do not perform all your duties, since you are our witch?",,1,BMINSC25
68171,Minsc,"Well... a Rashemani witch accompanies a ranger on his dajemma and teaches him the lore of herbs, among other things. Well... Minsc and Boo have discovered a need of some of this lore, maybe.",,1,BMINSC25
68175,Minsc,"After frolicking in a bush that we now consider to be of suspicious nature, both Boo and I have contracted the Calishite itch in rather... private places. A salve would be most joyously anticipated!",,1,BMINSC25
68180,Minsc,"Many thanks, Aerie! Soon, maybe, Boo can return his little mind to thoughts of butt-kicking instead of butt-itching, and I for one shall be very relieved!",,1,BMINSC25
68313,Minsc,"So, Anomen, Boo and I had a question about the lodge you seem to hold above all else.",MINS2507,1,BMINSC25
68377,Minsc,"Yes, that is the one. You view it with as much respect as I give the Ice Dragon Berserker Lodge of my homeland. If they are similar in their intent, we might seek to join.",,1,BMINSC25
68382,Minsc,Yes.,,1,BMINSC25
68385,Minsc,Yes.,,1,BMINSC25
68389,Minsc,"Boo understands the tone of your rejection, though he is confused as to why organizations of good intent must always ride atop the *ahem* pole of righteousness.",,1,BMINSC25
68498,Minsc,"What, what? Well, an admirable decision, but Boo is not for sale.",MINS2512,1,BMINSC25
68500,Minsc,"OH! Well then, by all means! And yes, very little requirements. Food, shelter, and perhaps the little wheel. I have heard nothing but good things about the little wheel.",,1,BMINSC25
68502,Minsc,"Of course. Boo is special among his kind, and quite resilient. Have I mentioned he is a miniature giant space hamster? I'm sure I have.",,1,BMINSC25
69000,Minsc,"Haer'Dalis, are you laughing at Boo and I? You are smiling after many of our battles.",MINS2508,1,BMINSC25
69006,Minsc,"Uh... but mostly evil, right?",,1,BMINSC25
69012,Minsc,"Boo, I think this bard is a little off in the head, no?",,1,BMINSC25
69228,Minsc,"Boo and I always are having time to speak with our friends. Yes, no, Boo?",MINS2514,1,BMINSC25
69230,Minsc,And now you would like a hamster.,,1,BMINSC25
69232,Minsc,Just a guess.,,1,BMINSC25
69234,Minsc,"As you wish, but I couldn't imagine a Minsc without a Boo. We are two peas in a pool, two fists in a face, two feet on the floor, and too much for most villainy.",,1,BMINSC25
69241,Minsc,"Eh... Boo, was that a compliment?",MINS2516,1,BMINSC25
69243,Minsc,Boo? He is young by the standards of his miniature giant cohorts.,,1,BMINSC25
69246,Minsc,"I believe he takes offense to the term ""rodent.""",,1,BMINSC25
69248,Minsc,"You know, try as he might, Boo just doesn't get your kind of humor.",,1,BMINSC25
69249,Minsc,"Eh, you know, with all that has been going on, Boo and I are having some trouble keeping our feet on the ground.",MINS2509,1,BMINSC25
69253,Minsc,"You will see no slacking in the sword arm of Minsc, but no matter the running start, I cannot cut through the heavens.",,1,BMINSC25
69254,Minsc,"Well, with all this talk of gods, where will Minsc and Boo fit in? Swords have little effect on the heavens.",,1,BMINSC25
69255,Minsc,"Oh, I am not confused. Clarity is ever my stalwart companion, but where do Minsc and Boo fit when we are battling gods?",,1,BMINSC25
69262,Minsc,"Nothing that *stands* can withstand it, but floaty specters of evil gods incarnate may as well be made of the hot air they spew.",,1,BMINSC25
69263,Minsc,"As motivational speeches go, that was not one of your best. Look, Boo shrivels with insecurity. I mean, he's a hamster; just how small do you think he can safely get?",,1,BMINSC25
69265,Minsc,"Well, I *believe* that I can stick a thumb in the eye of evil no matter what head it is moored to. Perhaps that is enough. We shall have to see.",,1,BMINSC25
69276,Minsc,"So, ""Sarevok,"" if that is your real name, what do you remember of our previous battles, hmm?",MINS2510,1,BMINSC25
69282,Minsc,"I am not completely convinced that you are who you say you are, standing there saying you are.",,1,BMINSC25
69291,Minsc,Boo agrees. You are welcome beside us if you effectively apply the boots of goodness.,,1,BMINSC25
69300,Minsc,"A fine choice of mentor, but again, you do not seem like a ""Sarevok"" to me. Too much ""humble,"" not enough ""RAAAAGH, feel my unholy rage.""",,1,BMINSC25
69302,Minsc,"Boo is an uncanny judge of character, but you... you give him trouble.",MINS2515,1,BMINSC25
69310,Minsc,"Food storage aside, Boo controls himself far better than you do. Do you see him ranting about mere glances? Let's look.",,1,BMINSC25
69312,Minsc,"There, you see? No rant. In fact, right now we see him snuffing about for a comfy place to sleep. Admirable restraint.",,1,BMINSC25
69314,Minsc,"Ah, finally a calming look across your face. Boo's handiwork, no doubt. Doesn't that feel better?",,1,BMINSC25
69922,Minsc,"Congratulations. Soon, this tiny one will be planting his wee feet into the backside of evil, just like his daddy! We should give him a tiny sword to wave at the villains as we battle! Oh... Boo says that may not be such a good idea.",,1,BMINSC25
70389,Minsc,"Look, Boo-everyone knows you now! See how their fame spreads like a scented cloud from your furry backside when you have had one too many crackers!",,1,MINSC25J
70413,Jaheira,"The natural order will scream in protest should this demon prince be allowed to walk freely through the realms. To preserve the balance, we must imprison the creature-or send it back to the Abyss.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
70431,Minsc,"Too much talk, not enough fight!",,1,MINSC25J
70431,Minsc,"Too much talk, not enough fight!",,1,MINSCJ
70435,Jaheira,I suspect this apparition's sense of duty is going to make our task more difficult.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
70439,Jaheira,As I feared... we must prove our worth to this spirit before we can complete this quest.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
70441,Minsc,"Eh? He is like bad penny, this one. An armored, deep-voiced penny of most sinister evil!",,1,MINSC25J
70507,Jaheira,"That is unworthy of you, Haer'Dalis. The lives of men hang in the balance.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
70524,Jaheira,"Interesting. A god was forced to deal with your Imprisoned One? No ordinary apparition, this.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
70530,Minsc,We have been betrayed after all! Even Boo cannot believe this. Look at his tiny head shaking in disbelief. Or maybe he is cold. No... definitely disbelief!,,1,MINSC25J
70530,Minsc,We have been betrayed after all! Even Boo cannot believe this. Look at his tiny head shaking in disbelief. Or maybe he is cold. No... definitely disbelief!,,1,MINSCJ
70541,Jaheira,"You may feel pity for yourself and justify your failure however you wish, Odren, but you attempted to murder us. I am surprised Helm does not turn away from you for such an affront.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
70550,Minsc,"So he wants to play a game? Minsc and Boo are fond of all sorts of games, although Boo is far better at the ones that need strategy. I am sad to say that I am far better at straightforward butt-kicking.",,1,MINSC25J
70550,Minsc,"So he wants to play a game? Minsc and Boo are fond of all sorts of games, although Boo is far better at the ones that need strategy. I am sad to say that I am far better at straightforward butt-kicking.",,1,MINSCJ
70561,Minsc,"I don't understand. The witch has her heart back... why is she not nicer to us? What? Oh... yes, I see. Uh-huh. Thank you, Boo. Boo is so smart.",,1,MINSC25J
71388,Minsc,"Be not sad, pretty waitress... you will make them stop. Or else Minsc and Boo will deliver an order of booted butt-stomping to the table of mean, ugly men!",,1,MINSC25J
71636,Minsc,"Oh, Boo, he is going to mention you in his book! Isn't he a nice man?",,1,MINSC25J
72330,Minsc,"Poor Mateo. He is alone in the world, as Minsc was before Boo found him. Yes, Boo-you are right! As heroes, we must befriend the friendless. We must help the helpless. We must deaccuse the accused. Er... well, you get the idea.",,1,MINSC25J
72353,Minsc,No... the lady must not die! You are a bad person! All who are true heroes of virtue join me in defending this woman against the naughty bad you!,,1,MINSC25J
72429,Minsc,"Boo does not trust this Kiser. See how his nose twitches? Something smells about this, and it is not stinky clouds from Boo's furry backside.",,1,MINSC25J
72571,Minsc,"Mighty heroes like Minsc and you cannot prove themselves against such unworthy opponents... maybe Boo should tackle them alone. Minsc is joking, of course. Let the kobold butt-kicking begin!",,1,MINSC25J
74513,Minsc,"He's not that ugly. Boo's seen much uglier half-orcs. Haven't you, Boo?",,1,MINSCJ
74583,Jaheira,You can't work with such as this. Have you forgotten all that Gorion taught you?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
74615,Minsc,Are you calling Boo a fool?,,1,MINSCJ
74692,Minsc,I'm with the hamster.,,1,MINSCJ
74809,Jaheira,Take a moment and think. What would Gorion say about this pointless bloodshed?,,1,JAHEIRAJ
74818,Minsc,Boo says it's rude to diminish a bride's radiance on her wedding day.,,1,MINSCJ
75712,Jaheira,"Careful. We want to walk into the gorge, not fall into it.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
75728,Minsc,"What do you think, Boo? Isn't this a nice tree?",,1,MINSCJ
75729,Minsc,Boo doesn't think this is a nice tree.,,1,MINSCJ
75730,Minsc,I think Boo is right.,,1,MINSCJ
77110,Jaheira,Beware. You cannot trust a tanar'ri.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
77677,Minsc,Speak for yourself! Boo is the warm center of the universe that I orbit during my slumber each night!,,1,MINSCJ
78870,Minsc,Trusts?,,1,MINSCJ
79469,Minsc,"Boo dislikes this place. These people are trapped in a wheel that turns and turns, but never moves forward.",,1,MINSCJ
79523,Minsc,"Boo dislikes this place. These people are trapped in a wheel that turns and turns, but never moves forward.",,1,MINSCJ
80995,Minsc,"It's all right, Boo. They're dead, but I'm sure they're not bad-",,1,MINSCJ
80996,Minsc,"You were right, Boo. They weren't nice at all.",,1,MINSCJ
81447,Jaheira,An evil one.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
81824,Minsc,Boo says smoking isn't healthy.,,1,MINSCJ
82680,Minsc,"Mad angry, not mad crazy.",,1,MINSC25J
82718,Minsc,For justice!,,1,MINSC25J
83155,Minsc,"What's that, Boo? You need to speak up; I can't hear you over the incredibly loud rumbling.",,1,MINSC25J
87844,Jaheira,We must proceed with caution. The Red Wizards are devious. They will expect retaliation.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
88081,Jaheira,"Animals should be wild, not kept as pets by wandering heroes. Tell Barad the gift is appreciated but inappropriate.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
88082,Minsc,"Minsc is torn! It seems only fair that you be able to walk with a small animal to advise them, too. But Minsc also fears for Boo... Dings might have a bad attitude toward hamsters.",,1,MINSCJ
88457,Jaheira,"The half-elf's magic may represent a threat to the balance, but I think she would do less harm with us than without us.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
88555,Minsc,"Let me guess! You admire Boo from afar. You have thought to yourself, ""Boo strong! Boo handsome!""",,1,BMINSC
88557,Minsc,Do not hold back! Out with it! Boo can take it!,,1,BMINSC
88559,Minsc,"Ah, yes! You are afraid Boo has become too mighty. You see how he looks into a demon's eyes and how the demon fears to meet his gaze!",,1,BMINSC
88561,Minsc,You imagine him finding a hole in dragon's armor and showing Minsc where to point his sword!,,1,BMINSC
88563,Minsc,"You think Boo will find sacred cup, pull sword from rock, destroy cursed ring, win golden branch, and kill big evil!",,1,BMINSC
88565,Minsc,"Die? Ha! Where Minsc goes, Boo follows, and where Boo goes, so does Minsc! Death has no sting for us!",,1,BMINSC
88566,Minsc,"No. Nooo! You, Neera! You did this!",,1,BMINSC
88568,Minsc,Your last spell. Your last spell did this to my Boo!,,1,BMINSC
88570,Minsc,"Ah, Boo! Your fur was like gold, like topaz, like dark honey from the meadows of Rashemen. And now…",,1,BMINSC
88571,Minsc,Pink! All pink.,,1,BMINSC
88573,Minsc,A HAMSTER IS NOT A FLOWER.,,1,BMINSC
88575,Minsc,No! No more spells! Boo and I will stand over here. Way over here!,,1,BMINSC
88576,Minsc,Neera? Boo and I would like to say sorry.,,1,BMINSC
88578,Minsc,Boo says he didn't mind being pink. It was nice change. I kind of liked it too.,,1,BMINSC
88580,Minsc,Minsc is a berserker. Minsc understands.,,1,BMINSC
88582,Minsc,"A little messy, but easier to fix!",,1,BMINSC
88620,Minsc,Boo and Minsc wish you found a good name! But Minsc and Boo are also not sorry you've stopped looking.,,1,BMINSC25
89488,Jaheira,"Ha. My advice has the virtue of being in the common tongue, at least. And I can take the shape of a bear when I please.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
89527,Jaheira,Refusing to engage with him further was wise. I sense that he is a part of the magic that infects this forest.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
89867,Minsc,"They do have nice voices, don't they, Boo?",,1,MINSC25J
90282,Minsc,Boo says we should find the hairband! Boo believes the children are our future!,,1,MINSCJ
92114,Minsc,"Don't worry, Boo. No one will leave you behind.",,1,MINSC25J
92235,Minsc,Boo knew where the Pavilion of Righteous Wrath was the whole time. The space hamster is no stranger to Lunia.,,1,MINSC25J
93536,Minsc,"You will need an advisor, heir to the throne! It is Minsc's opinion that hamsters make the best advisors.",,1,MINSCJ
96641,Jaheira,You disappoint me more than I could ever say. I am glad Gorion is not around to see this.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
98861,Minsc,I'm sorry. I thought you were talking to Boo.,,1,BMINSC
98863,Minsc,I am.,,1,BMINSC
98865,Minsc,"No, no! It was my dajemma that brought me here. That and-my witch.",,1,BMINSC
98867,Minsc,I failed the dajemma. I failed my witch. I failed myself.,,1,BMINSC
98869,Minsc,"Boo understands. Boo forgives, even if I cannot.",,1,BMINSC
98871,Minsc,Boo thinks you are a good man. You should come to Rashemen with us when I return there. We could parade around Immilmar-I'd introduce you as my long-lost brother. Hah! Wouldn't that be something?,,1,BMINSC
99296,Minsc,"Are you sure...? She's-well, you know.",,1,BMINSC
99297,Minsc,"She SEEMS nice, yes, but still-vampire.",,1,BMINSC
99299,Minsc,"No, they aren't.",,1,BMINSC
99301,Minsc,I was talking to Boo.,,1,BMINSC
99303,Minsc,Boo says you aren't what you seem.,,1,BMINSC
99305,Minsc,You... RECOGNIZE giant space hamsters?,,1,BMINSC
99307,Minsc,Boo is right. You aren't a normal vampire.,,1,BMINSC
99309,Minsc,Maybe it's all right that you're with us after all.,,1,BMINSC
99311,Minsc,Well. You're a vampire.,,1,BMINSC
99313,Minsc,Boo thinks... you're all right.,,1,BMINSC
99315,Minsc,No! Never!,,1,BMINSC
99317,Minsc,Yes. I'll do that.,,1,BMINSC
99713,Minsc,"Boo says he doesn't fully trust you, half-orc.",,1,BMINSC
99715,Minsc,Giant space hamsters aren't easy to fool.,,1,BMINSC
99717,Minsc,You will? Good. That's good.,,1,BMINSC
99725,Minsc,Boo says-,,1,BMINSC
100114,Jaheira,do you think it wise to spend so much time with Dorn? He seems to have taken an unhealthy interest in you.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
100115,Jaheira,He is not to be trusted.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
100116,Jaheira,He is a murderous half-orc with an unquenchable bloodlust. He is incapable of the feelings you and I possess.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
100117,Jaheira,"If you intend to take up with a barbaric half-orc, I must end this.",,1,JAHEIRAJ
100118,Jaheira,I am relieved to hear that.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
100119,Jaheira,I am glad Gorion did not live to see this.,,1,JAHEIRAJ
101966,Minsc,"Friend Rasaad, I have a question, and Boo is being most uncooperative. What is a honeymoon?",,1,BMINSC25
101968,Minsc,So there are no bees?,,1,BMINSC25
101971,Minsc,I shall take your word for it. Boo's answer involved both bees and birds. It was... confusing.,,1,BMINSC25
102079,Minsc,"Ahh, Dorn. Even you must sense the cheer in the air!",,1,BMINSC25
102081,Minsc,Minsc and Boo would like to see you try! We would whistle all the while as we stamped your bones to dust!,,1,BMINSC25
